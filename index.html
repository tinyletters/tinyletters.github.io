  <head>Tiny Letters</head>
  <p>Tiny letters for mothers is an artistic research project that aims to create a global network of data stories about
    the first 40 days / 6 weeks postpartum. The title tiny letters is borne of Dee Marco’s 40+day postpartum writing
    after the birth of her third child in 2023. Her candid and sometimes raw and scary recollections of the time set off
    a series of conversations that led to the best kind of working collaboration – one where mums work together. Dee and
    creative developer Lara Koseff embark on this journey of learning about global experiences of mothers by creating a
    data story through tiny letters from one mum to another, from one geography to another, from one illogical moment to
    another.</p>
