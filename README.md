# tiny letters for mothers

Tiny letters for mothers is an artistic research project that aims to create a global network of data stories about mothering and parenting, especially in the early stages. Our first data story is focussed on the first 40 days / 6 weeks postpartum, and on the birth stories of mothers or coming home stories in the context of adoption. The title tiny letters is borne of Dee Marco’s 40+day postpartum writing after the birth of her third child in 2023. Her candid and sometimes raw and scary recollections of the time set off a series of conversations that led to the best kind of working collaboration – one where mums work together. Dee and creative developer Lara Koseff embark on this journey of learning about global experiences of mothers and parents by creating a data story through tiny letters from one mum to another, from one geography to another, from one illogical moment to another.
