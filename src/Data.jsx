    "It was a planned C-section at a time when covid was setting in. It was lonely, as no family members could travel due covid restrictions. There is a weird sense of unpreparedness and uncertainty. My husband was asked to leave within an hour of delivery. He could only come back on the day if discharge. To navigate all the newness completely alone was quite a thing. It took us about 30 minutes in the theatre after the epidural. The doctors were extremely chatty, with each other. Discussing other cases etc etc. Did not make it look like anything. I don't know to feel about it. Felt a lot of pressure/ thrust at one point. Soon they exclaimed, 'it's a girl', lots of black hair, eh?! My husband looked very flushed and in a trance the whole time until he saw his daughter. He was soon rushed along other doctors for primary check up of the child. I remember shivering rigorously in the recovery room. Being back on the bed, I couldn't still feel my lower body. Suddenly realised the nurse came to change the bedding. In looking I saw a huge patch of blood on the sheet. At that very point, making everything look like a part of the process I was asked to let my new born latch. At that very point, I realised one of core aspects of parenting. To keep at it, no matter what. What followed ever since, is a practical living lesson of this first learning of motherhood. [I didn't have the baby] blues exactly. Felt very overwhelmed for sure. Nothing [was in place for me as a new mother]. It was just the two of us trying to navigate. No family, did not have a community of friends here at that point.",

    birthStory:
      "I wanted a VBAC because I never got the experience of birthing a baby first time round. My overarching feelings are of regret because I never got to experience labour like other people do. I never got to give birth. In reality that is not what I felt at the time. I felt helpless and panicked before and during the birth. I was threatened with sedation if I did not calm down. It was my second caesar, and I hate the whole experience of being pushed and pulled and no one tells you what is happening. And this was worse because I never even got to hold my baby. They worked on her and would not allow her to lie on me, I could not ask what was going on for fear of disturbing their work and there was a shift change so no nurses came to relieve the paed. I was numb and could not move, it felt like a very long time. I think I was a bit mentally numb due to panic, I could not think so just lay there suspended in this state but without actually feeling. I think I have forgotten a lot of how it felt now. First 6 weeks were hell. Even past the hospital time we then had to force feed her with a bottle. She was not able to breast feed. But pumping was hell. We got specialist midwives to come and help us learn how to bottle feed her because she would just scream when we tried. We closeted ourselves away from everyone and everything and just pumped and force fed her in cycles of 2 to 3 hours. I kept a notebook with all the volumes she drank to make sure she was getting enough and weighed her obsessively. I slept in the same chair I pumped in and forgot to shower. I only ate because I had food brought to me. My son had the roughest time because his mother was suddenly unable to care for him and I could not cope with him being loud or boisterous in the room while I was pumping (too little) so I felt like a failure on both fronts. I will always regret not handling that better. [During labour I felt] helpless, like we were sliding toward the inevitable because labour did not progress. I needed information and plans of action but got none from midwife. Was told just to wait it out. [I had] difficulties breast feeding so had to pump – was extremely hard coupled with usual exhaustion. I have diastasis recti and have to have surgery to rectify but it's costly. I just never got my body back. [During the first week I remember] hospital, Ubering back and forth with milk because they keep your baby but kick you out! Guilt for allowing them to keep her from being held. Guilt for not pumping enough and for leaving the hospital at all to go sleep. Tree fell on the driveway in the middle of all this and I was unreasonably panicked about getting there with the milk! I actually got more sleep without baby at home. At the end of this week we got to hold her but it was just so scary and difficult that I am not sure I got the full pleasure one normally gets out of that. [My post-partum support was my] husband. Not entirely as he was just in the same situation as me really. But he did wake first and wash bottles then wake me to pump and it helped. [I returned to work] – mining company head office. Various elements at play here. Pumping was supported correctly. High-pressure job but once COVID hit we had time together and only recently returned to office more than once a week. Got lucky. I now have to travel and being pushed for more so less support the older they get. [I felt myself emerge again after] we did a milestone visit to restaurant for older brother's sake at 2 months. He was only 4 and had a rough time so we took him out with baby. Spent 1.5 hour at closest restaurant with playground and felt so victorious. Wild times. Overall, I I think this happened very slowly. I do know what you mean because I had this first time round. But this was gradual and I hid at home for maternity leave. Possibly just happy to be able to feed baby and cherishing the time because the start was rough. I don't have specific time but more like a series of steps that incrementally got me there.",

    birthStory:
      "My oldest was born in 2018. He was 10 days overdue and after fully preparing for natural birth with hypnobirthing I ended up having an emergency c-section. I was absolutely ready as can be for birth, but with each day that passed I felt no dropping and no pain at all. I was as comfortable as ever at 41 weeks walking around waterfront Harbour. I was induced at 40 weeks+ 10 days. I went into the midwife birthing hospital at 8pm in the evening where I was induced and slept for the night. The next morning I was made comfortable and the day began. My water still hadn't broken by 8pm and the midwife assisted. Still nothing, but once I turned to get up and pee I felt a warm wuuush. I was relieved and believed at this point things would pick up. The contractions became more and more intense. Most of the day was a blur of focus, bouncing on a ball and eating watermelon. I remember the Dr coming in now and then asking about if I requested analgesics, I did not. I was in the zone. The contractions were coming hard and fast but I was not dilating. I remember he midwife told me to climb some light stairs. At this point contractions were fast and I was getting nausea from the pain on the stairs. I went back and had only dilated 2 cm. The midwife recommended the c-section assuming that my son's neck was a bit stuck, but he was fine and not in any stress. I was quite scared with the process that happened next. It all happened fast and did not allow me the same space and peace I was looking forward to, but everyone was very kind and gentle. I was the only patient in the hospital so that was strange but also welcomed, no mania, no panic and no sharing staff. The anaethetist was lovely. She made me feel calm and relaxed despite knowing I was getting a huge spinal injection. Years later we found out that lovely lady died in a car accident soon after my son's birth. The pushing on my stomach to get the baby out was very strange and a bit painful (a lot of pressure), but once I heard the crying I forgot about the entire 24 hours. Our blessing arrived, on his own time. My recovery is an uncommon story. I got an infection in my cut soon after my first gynae check up. Carting a new born to a hospital every day for more than a week for a wound to be drained,hearing his screaming outside the room for me was horrible. I wish that experience on no mother. Trying to recover and comfort a newborn who I didn't even fully understand yet was torture. I never fully understood what kind of rest and recovery a c section needed, I should have taken it slower. I knew better for the next one. After that I could properly heal. I remember pain but can't quite quantity it. [The first week was] quiet quiet quiet, no sleep – that was weird, getting used to a big sleep interruption that like. You never can understand it unless you go through it. Baby struggled to latch the entire first 2 weeks, his weight dropped more than usual. It was... something else. Husband and mom [were post partum support]. Enough support, not overwhelming. I was let go during maternity leave from my work contract. It was not renewed. I freelance. In hind sight it was a blessing to get more time. It was close to 2 years [before I felt myself emerge]. I just remember the feeling of being more me.",

    birthOnly: `My oldest was born in 2018. He was 10 days overdue and after fully preparing for natural birth with hypnobirthing I ended up having an emergency c-section. I was absolutely ready as can be for birth, but with each day that passed I felt no dropping and no pain at all. I was as comfortable as ever at 41 weeks walking around waterfront Harbour. I was induced at 40 weeks+ 10 days. I went into the midwife birthing hospital at 8pm in the evening where I was induced and slept for the night. The next morning I was made comfortable and the say began. My water still hadn't broken by 8pm and the midwife assisted. Still nothing, but once I turned to get up and pee I felt a warm wuuush. I was relieved and believed at this point things would pick up. The contractions became more and more intense. Most of the day was a blur of focus, bouncing on a ball and eating watermelon. I remember the Dr coming in now and then asking about if I requested analgesics, I did not. I was in the zone. The contractions were coming hard and fast but I was not dilating. I remember he midwife told me to climb some light stairs. At this point contractions were fast and I was getting nausea from the pain on the stairs. I went back and had only dilated 2 cm. The midwife recommended the c-section assuming that my son's neck was a bit stuck, but he was fine and not in any stress. \n I was quite scared with the process that happened next. It all happened fast and did not allow me the same space and peace I was looking forward to, but everyone was very kind and gentle. I was the only patient in the hospital so that was strange but also welcomed, no mania, no panic and no sharing staff. \n The anaethetist was lovely.

      "My daughter’s birth was a surprise, but a beautiful one. I was supposed to have a caesarean but she arrived early so I gave birth naturally, relying completely on the inherent wisdom of the female body. I breathed through it, drew on inner strength and it was truly a magical experience. I felt I had to take charge of the situation as the doctor was in a state, it was the midst of Covid, and my husband was fearful of natural birth. Because I hadn’t expected a natural childbirth I didn’t expect any sensations nor any consequences of the birth. In retrospect I am glad for this, however, I realise that knowledge is power with child birth and ensure the safety and health of mother and child. I felt like the bottom of my body was falling out! But I also felt calm and in control. I breathed a lot - as if meditating - to keep the baby calm and help her enter the world peacefully.The first 40 days were tricky - my husband was supportive but not as I had imagined. I also still had to work. It was all a bit surreal, looking back! I would have more [children] if I were significantly younger! [The first week was] A juggle! But peaceful. Trying to figure out what to do, and settling into what it means to have a baby. My husband helped a bit but I don’t think it was I really needed. I don’t have any other support. I was also still working. I am thankful I have good health and am strong, so was able to pull it together and make it work. I hope to be around for my daughter if she has children so I can be there for her. I am a consultant so no work – no pay… It was a long time after [that I felt myself emerge]… maybe close to 3 plus years! Then I started to see glimmers of my old self. It made me realise what I had undergone. I don’t think I had realised it but had simply kept going…",

    birthStory:
      "I gave birth in the middle of the storm that is COVID. I was alone – husband was not allowed – restrictions. It was night time when my contractions started – after timing them for an hour, I was convinced that it was time. Without night time driving permits, my husband took me to the hospital which was an hour and 30 minutes away.  When we got there, I had to endure a COVID test done while I was twisting and turning from a painful contraction. The nurse on call was not very happy to see me – she was irritable and very short with me (maybe she had a long day). But she kept calling me Sisi. That was really annoying me. But I didn't want to escalate an already tense situation. She initially thought I wasn't in labour, she kept asking me if I was sure, but in a very sarcastic manner. I decided not to match her energy. Fast forward to a while later, I am admitted – she had satisfied her requirements, which included sticking what felt like her whole arm inside my vagina while I was having a contraction. I spent most of the night twisting and rolling on the bed, walking about in the corridors, pushing through the floods of painful contractions. I endure, I think about my baby boy, I breath in and out, like how they show you on those YouTube videos. Now and again, the nurses check if all is in order – its almost the break of dawn. I remember thinking how this time tomorrow, i'll be having my baby and all of this will be behind me. The time comes, I am fully dilated and ready for the next phase - they make me walk to the birthing ward – I am tired, but excited and sad because my husband is not here to share in the moment. I let the excitement of meeting my boy carry me, I promise myself to be strong and do what the nurses tell me. I start to push, i start and stop as instructed – I give it my best shot. One last push, make it a big one Sisi, someone instructs... I take the deepest breath yet and  i push. Someone else shouts – something is wrong, get the Dr. Within seconds the room was filled with so many people. .someone shouts, the baby is too big, his shoulders are stuck, we need to rotate blah blah... there's fingers or things shoved up my vagina, others hoist my legs up, there's a nurse on top of me pushing down on my stomach, while others hold my legs up... I lost my will – I just lay there, tossed, probed – I just go with it... I couldn't comprehend what was happening, and how fast it was happening. There's a lot of shouting, I feel a needle in my hand, another drip of some sort, someone said I was slipping... but I think to myself, 'I'm here', or was I, I don't know. They get him out eventually, at 12 midday. There was a  giant clock just in front of me that told me so. Its funny how I didn't notice it before. There was such a big relief when he was pushed or pulled out, I don't know. I just felt a big force and he was out - relief from amount of pressure i was feeling. He's not crying. Someone whisked him off to another table where he was surrounded by a group of people, all moving very fast... I just laid there, numb really. I thought about my husband, what will I say to my husband. I remember thinking, am I going to go home without a baby. I heard a very faint cry, very soft, very tired. That cry jolted me back to life. I was slipping away with my baby.  They placed him on my chest, momentarily, while the Dr was explaining what was going happen with him. They were taking him to the children's hospital, they will keep me updated and just like that he was gone. He was huge baby and his hands were white and a head full of hair – he looked like his father. I had 4th degree tearing, I had to go to surgery to get repaired. I only managed to speak to my husband almost 6 hours after I had given birth. I only saw my baby again the next day, early evening. We were in NICU for few days. His diagnosis overall was not severe, he had a mild shoulder dystocia, no brain damage but will have to be monitored for the next 6 years for any developmental/learning difficulties. By all accounts – he was expected to recover with mild physiotherapy for his shoulder. What followed was a tough journey to bond – to breastfeed – to heal. The overwhelm of early parenthood, the hormonal shifts, the trauma. He is three years old now. I was very stressed because i was going to be alone during the delivery. The lack of support from my husband made me very anxious. Physically, a 4th-degree tear came with complications. Weak pelvic floor, incontinence. Sex life – I was scared of physical penetration, in part because of the possible pain but also thinking if he will enjoy having sex with me again after so much tearing.  It caused tension in my marriage. Emotionally, it was very traumatic – and every year on his birthday, I got back there. I think about the trauma on my baby's big day. I feel sad that I will think about it every year. [During the first week] I was in so much pain. I couldn't sit properly because of the tearing. I was struggling with breastfeeding possibly from the trauma of birth, my milk was just not flowing right – which caused even more stress. We were discharged on a Friday and had a follow-up appointment the coming Monday. He was diagnosed with jaundice that Monday and we were readmitted on the spot. I cried, a lot. I had to endure another COVID test and another three nights in hospital, without my husband. I cried a lot during that time. I was interviewed by a psychologist during the first routine clinic visit, where I was very honest and open about my struggles but nothing came of it. I didn't pursue any further psychological support after that.  I read the 40 days postpartum newsletter religiously – it made me feel that I was not alone in the lot of the emotions I was feeling. My husband's job requires him to travel away from home quite a lot – so he was mostly away during my pregnancy and the baby was born. My mother came to stay and help for the first four weeks. I went back [to work] after 5 months. I am a Lecturer. My institution was supportive in allowing for a more flexible work schedule. The workload however was still unmanageable. Have I emerged even? Some parts are back, others are probably lost forever, and others are new, adaptive really. But I started to feel a little more capable when the baby was around 8-12 months old. I knew I was feeling more capable because I could go out with him to places without the overwhelming anxiety that used to accompany me. I was also doing my hair again and generally putting in some effort to regain some sense of my old self. ",

    birthOnly: `I gave birth in the middle of the storm that is COVID. I was alone – husband was not allowed – restrictions. It was night time when my contractions started – after timing them for an hour, I was convinced that it was time. Without night time driving permits, my husband took me to the hospital which was an hour and 30 minutes away.  
    \n
    When we got there, I had to endure a COVID test done while I was twisting and turning from a painful contraction. The nurse on call was not very happy to see me – she was irritable and very short with me (maybe she had a long day). But she kept calling me Sisi. That was really annoying me. But I didn't want to escalate an already tense situation. She initially thought I wasn't in labour, she kept asking me if I was sure, but in a very sarcastic manner. I decided not to match her energy. 
    \n
    Fast forward to a while later, I am admitted – she had satisfied her requirements, which included sticking what felt like her whole arm inside my vagina while I was having a contraction.
    \n
    I spent most of the night twisting and rolling on the bed, walking about in the corridors, pushing through the floods of painful contractions. I endure, I think about my baby boy, I breath in and out, like how they show you on those YouTube videos. Now and again, the nurses check if all is in order – its almost the break of dawn. I remember thinking how this time tomorrow, I'll be having my baby and all of this will be behind me. 
    \n
    The time comes, I am fully dilated and ready for the next phase – they make me walk to the birthing ward – I am tired, but excited and sad because my husband is not here to share in the moment. I let the excitement of meeting my boy carry me, I promise myself to be strong and do what the nurses tell me. 
    \n
    I start to push, I start and stop as instructed – I give it my best shot. One last push, make it a big one Sisi, someone instructs... I take the deepest breath yet and I push. Someone else shouts – something is wrong, get the Dr. Within seconds the room was filled with so many people... someone shouts, the baby is too big, his shoulders are stuck, we need to rotate blah blah... there's fingers or things shoved up my vagina, others hoist my legs up, there's a nurse on top of me pushing down on my stomach, while others hold my legs up... I lost my will – I just lay there, tossed, probed – I just go with it... I couldn't comprehend what was happening, and how fast it was happening. There's a lot of shouting, I feel a needle in my hand, another drip of some sort, someone said I was slipping... but I think to myself, "I'm here", or was I, I don't know. 
    \n
    They get him out eventually, at 12 midday. There was a  giant clock just in front of me that told me so. Its funny how I didn't notice it before. There was such a big relief when he was pushed or pulled out, I don't know. I just felt a big force and he was out – relief from amount of pressure I was feeling.
    \n
    He's not crying. Someone whisked him off to another table where he was surrounded by a group of people, all moving very fast... I just laid there, numb really. I thought about my husband, what will I say to my husband. I remember thinking, am I going to go home without a baby. 
    \n
    I heard a very faint cry, very soft, very tired. That cry jolted me back to life. I was slipping away with my baby.  They placed him on my chest, momentarily, while the Dr was explaining what was going happen with him. They were taking him to the children's hospital, they will keep me updated and just like that he was gone. He was huge baby and his hands were white and a head full of hair – he looked like his father.
    \n
    I had 4th degree tearing, I had to go to surgery to get repaired. I only managed to speak to my husband almost 6 hours after I had given birth. I only saw my baby again the next day, early evening.
    \n
    We were in NICU for few days. His diagnosis overall was not severe, he had a mild shoulder dystocia, no brain damage but will have to be monitored for the next 6 years for any developmental/learning difficulties. By all accounts – he was expected to recover with mild physiotherapy for his shoulder. 
    \n
    What followed was a tough journey to bond – to breastfeed – to heal. The overwhelm of early parenthood, the hormonal shifts, the trauma. He is three years old now.
    `,
    firstFortyDays: `Physically, a 4th-degree tear came with complications. Weak pelvic floor, incontinence. Sex life – I was scared of physical penetration, in part because of the possible pain but also thinking if he will enjoy having sex with me again after so much tearing. It caused tension in my marriage.
    \n
    Emotionally, it was very traumatic – and every year on his birthday, I got back there. I think about the trauma on my baby's big day. I feel sad that I will think about it every year. /n [During the first week] I was in so much pain. I couldn't sit properly because of the tearing. I was struggling with breastfeeding possibly from the trauma of birth, my milk was just not flowing right – which caused even more stress. We were discharged on a Friday and had a follow-up appointment the coming Monday. He was diagnosed with jaundice that Monday and we were readmitted on the spot. I cried, a lot. 
    \n
    I had to endure another COVID test and another three nights in hospital, without my husband. I cried a lot during that time. /n I was interviewed by a psychologist during the first routine clinic visit, where I was very honest and open about my struggles but nothing came of it. I didn't pursue any further psychological support after that.  I read the 40 days postpartum newsletter religiously – it made me feel that I was not alone in the lot of the emotions I was feeling. /n My husband's job requires him to travel away from home quite a lot – so he was mostly away during my pregnancy and the baby was born. My mother came to stay and help for the first four weeks. /n I went back [to work] after 5 months. I am a Lecturer. My institution was supportive in allowing for a more flexible work schedule. The workload however was still unmanageable. /n Have I emerged even? some parts are back, others are probably lost forever, and others are new, adaptive really. But I started to feel a little more capable when the baby was around 8-12 months old. I knew I was feeling more capable because I could go out with him to places without the overwhelming anxiety that used to accompany me. I was also doing my hair again and generally putting in some effort to regain some sense of my old self.`,

      "After months of anticipation, the day finally arrived when we were set to welcome our second baby. Unlike with our first child, this time we knew what to expect in a planned C-section which brought a different kind of calm and excitement. A day before, we made sure everything was ready for the big day—bags packed, our older child staying with family, and the house prepped for bringing a newborn home. At the hospital, we were prepped for surgery, and everything seemed to move so quickly. The nurses were incredibly kind, walking us through each step. We had a private room where we relaxed until it was time to give both. Soon enough, I was in the operating room, the lights bright and everything feeling a bit surreal. My husband was right there by my side, holding my hand. Once the anesthetic kicked in, I couldn't feel anything from the waist down, but I was fully aware of the moment. I could feel pressure but no pain. Within 4 minutes, I heard the first cry of our baby boy. He was a beautiful, healthy boy! It was love all over again, just like the first time but different in its own way. After I held the baby for a few minutes, my husband left the room with our son while the doctors finished the surgery. Soon after, I was in recovery, and my baby was placed on my chest for skin-to-skin. I had a bad reaction to the anaesthetic and was fighting hard to stay awake while family gathered around the hospital bed to see baby. In retrospect, I would have preferred to not have had visitors immediately after giving birth. Recovery from the C-section was different than with my first birth, I experienced a lot of pain once I was released from hospital but in terms of taking care of baby, I was better prepared. [During the first week], baby was peaceful although physically I was in severe pain due to not having the correct meds. As a result I stopped breastfeeding very soon after birth. My husband was home and taking care of our older daughter for a week. Thereafter she returned to nursery school full time.  Our moms were also around to help bath baby and take care of him for short periods while I rested. We had domestic help for 3 days a week to keep our home neat and tidy. I was scheduled to return to work, but due to a compulsory mandate to return to office full time I resigned. Prior to giving birth, I had worked remotely for 4 years. [I felt myself reemerge] once I was physically healed and was able to be completely mobile again. Approximately 3 months after giving birth.",

    birthStory:
      "I have three children. In 2021 my family and I moved to the other side of the world, upon arrival I realised I was pregnant. I entered my new home through the maternity system. Pregnancy and birthing care in The Netherlands are midwife led. We planned a home birth. My previous births had been straightforward vaginal births so I was considered low risk and home births are encouraged in The Netherlands. In addition, I have little to no support here - there was no one to leave my other two children with when I went into labour (assuming my partner was present at the labour) so a home birth was the easiest option. My waters broke shortly after midnight on the 1st of January 2022, fireworks were still exploding all around us, the Dutch are obsessed with fireworks at New year. Our daughter was born approximately 3 hours later. I had rented an inflatable bath for a water birth. I enjoyed being in the water but found it slowed down my labour. I spent a fair amount of time climbing in and out of the water during the labour. My labours have all been straightforward and fairly quick but I enjoyed this home birth, I wouldn't say I enjoyed the other births. It was a very surreal experience, wondering around my living room in our tiny apartment in The Hague. Climbing in and out of the inflatable bath, slowly feeling the contractions speeding up. I sometimes sat on a birthing stool too that the midwife had brought along. She had arrived straight from her new years party. At first there was no assistant nurse because it was new year and it was hard to get hold of people. But the midwife found someone who arrived fairly quickly. The room wasn't even properly furnished, we took a long time to get things like furniture for various reasons. There was a Christmas tree still up in the corner. The midwife switched off all the lights and lit candles and put on the Christmas lights. Very atmospheric. I remember hearing music coming from outside, there were people partying in the street. At one point I could hear 'ice ice baby' by Vanilla Ice playing. Officially it was still strict lockdown because of Covid and no gatherings were allowed so people were in the street flaunting the rules. My husband was there most of the time, he was making tea for the midwife and nurse. At one point he had to check on the other kids, our older son woke up and he had to put him back to bed. The final delivery took place in the water with my husband right next to me and the midwife near by, I delivered my own baby with guidance from the midwife. The most astonishing thing was that the baby was a girl. We did not know what we were having and so far had boys. For some reason I thought I was having another boy. I loved her instantly. She was perfect. Did I feel safe, yes, was I afraid, no. I do not enjoy being pregnant so once I had given birth I was very relieved. It turned out my older two children did not go back to sleep and sat at the top of the stairs listening to everything. I think I liked that everyone was involved in the process, even if only in a distant way. Straight after the birth I was left wrapped up on the couch for at least an hour with my baby. It was an amazing experience. There was something comforting about being in my own home and then later being able to climb into my own bed. Compared to a hospital birth I found it much more relaxing, reassuring and empowering. My midwife was amazing. Labour is a weird process of completely letting go, I do not struggle with pain in labour, my pain tolerance is very high. I find myself trying to connect deeply with my body, listening to and feeling every sensation fully. I lose all sense of shame or even awareness of things like clothing. It is very basic in many ways, awareness of my breath is heightened. Yes, there is pain but for some reason it doesn't feel so important. The first 6 weeks were easy and difficult. My body slowly started adjusting. I was in a lot of pain, there was a problem with my pelvis which I eventually corrected with lots of exercise therapy. I developed shingles, which was not great. All my children got chickenpox shortly after this, not from me having shingles but from school. The baby had chickenpox too. It was easier because the baby was my third and I knew what to expect, I knew how to breastfeed etc. It was so hard because I was so far away from my support network. It was just me and my husband trying to hold it together with three children in a new country. We hadn't even been there a year. All my babies were wanted, nothing went as planned. The first week was easy. In The Netherlands they have Kraamzorg - maternity care. A dedicated nurse comes to your home for several hours everyday for the first 8 days. They will do whatever you ask them to do, clean, cook, play with your other children, bath the baby. They check on how breastfeeding is going, how you are sleeping, they give advice. It makes the first week easy. In addition, my partner took paternity leave. We rested, he spent time with the other children helping them to adjust, he cooked meals. I spent most of my time in bed feeding the baby or sleeping. It was very restful. It was just me and my husband, my husband works full time. I didn't have any family nearby, childcare is expensive here and there are long waiting list. It's hard to even find someone to help with cleaning. So my expectations to work were low, I had not been able to start working when we arrived. As a self employed person it has been hard to build new networks especially as I am the primary care giver. I progressed post partum at my own slow place. I found an exercise therapist to help with my pelvis. I went to pilates. Small things for me. My partner has been very supportive. He has done a huge amount while working full time and supporting us all. He cleans, he cooks, he takes the children to school, sometimes he fetches them. He has taken time off work if and when necessary. The Netherlands is supportive of partners being flexible and particpatory in childcare, which has also helped. He does not feel bad if he takes time off work to help with family stuff. He has worked a lot from home so that he can be more available to help. I want to [return to work] but I don't need to, I don't know what will happen in the future. I'm an artist and I feel very unsupported by the arts industry. We live in a very tiny apartment and currently can't afford to move. Sometimes we talk about me working because it might help with this but we can't figure out the childcare thing – it's expensive and waiting lists. It makes the most sense for me to wait until my youngest starts primary school when school becomes free.",

Officially it was still strict lockdown because of Covid and no gatherings were allowed so people were in the street flaunting the rules.\n My husband was there most of the time, he was making tea for the midwife and nurse. At one point he had to check on the other kids, our older son woke up and he had to put him back to bed. \nThe final delivery took place in the water with my husband right next to me and the midwife near by, I delivered my own baby with guidance from the midwife. The most astonishing thing was that the baby was a girl. We did not know what we were having and so far had boys. For some reason I thought I was having another boy. I loved her instantly. She was perfect.\n Did I feel safe, yes, was I afraid, no.\n I do not enjoy being pregnant so once I had given birth I was very relieved. It turned out my older two children did not go back to sleep and sat at the top of the stairs listening to everything. I think I liked that everyone was involved in the process, even if only in a distant way. \nStraight after the birth I was left wrapped up on the couch for at least an hour with my baby. It was an amazing experience. There was something comforting about being in my own home and then later being able to climb into my own bed. Compared to a hospital birth I found it much more relaxing, reassuring and empowering. My midwife was amazing. \nAll my babies were wanted, nothing went as planned. \n Labour is a weird process of completely letting go, I do not struggle with pain in labour, my pain tolerance is very high. I find myself trying to connect deeply with my body, listening to and feeling every sensation fully. I lose all sense of shame or even awareness of things like clothing. It is very basic in many ways, awareness of my breath is heightened. Yes, there is pain but for some reason it doesn't feel so important.`,
    firstFortyDays: `The first 6 weeks were easy and difficult. My body slowly started adjusting. I was in a lot of pain, there was a problem with my pelvis which I eventually corrected with lots of exercise therapy. I developed shingles, which was not great. All my children got chickenpox shortly after this, not from me having shingles but from school. The baby had chickenpox too. It was easier because the baby was my third and I knew what to expect, I knew how to breastfeed etc. It was so hard because I was so far away from my support network. It was just me and my husband trying to hold it together with three children in a new country. We hadn't even been there a year.  \n The first week was easy. In The Netherlands they have Kraamzorg - maternity care. A dedicated nurse comes to your home for several hours everyday for the first 8 days. They will do whatever you ask them to do, clean, cook, play with your other children, bath the baby. They check on how breastfeeding is going, how you are sleeping, they give advice. It makes the first week easy. In addition, my partner took paternity leave. We rested, he spent time with the other children helping them to adjust, he cooked meals. I spent most of my time in bed feeding the baby or sleeping. It was very restful. \nIt was just me and my husband, my husband works full time. I didn't have any family nearby, childcare is expensive here and there are long waiting list. It's hard to even find someone to help with cleaning. So my expectations to work were low, I had not been able to start working when we arrived. As a self employed person it has been hard to build new networks especially as I am the primary care giver. I progressed post partum at my own slow place. I found an exercise therapist to help with my pelvis. I went to pilates. Small things for me. \nMy partner has been very supportive. He has done a huge amount while working full time and supporting us all. He cleans, he cooks, he takes the children to school, sometimes he fetches them. He has taken time off work if and when necessary. The Netherlands is supportive of partners being flexible and particpatory in childcare, which has also helped. He does not feel bad if he takes time off work to help with family stuff. He has worked a lot from home so that he can be more available to help. \nI want to [return to work] but I don't need to, I don't know what will happen in the future. I'm an artist and I feel very unsupported by the arts industry. We live in a very tiny apartment and currently can't afford to move. Sometimes we talk about me working because it might help with this but we can't figure out the childcare thing – it's expensive and waiting lists. It makes the most sense for me to wait until my youngest starts primary school when school becomes free.`,

    birthStory:
      "Leaving the house was a very dramatic affair. I'd had two physical examinations - Karen checked once, after my water had broken in the passage - a big, gushing whoosh of release. I laughed, in my hot pink workout top and blue sarong around my hips. After my waters broke I abandoned the kikoy. I remember how in each pregnancy there's a moment that you forget your body for being a living thing that can be made pretty or fresher or lovelier or anything at all beyond a labouring body. My waters had never broken before - in the first labour, my midwife broke it and because I was already a few hours into labour (and laying down if I remember correctly), I didn't feel much. With the second one, she came with the waters! With this one, I wasn't expecting the waters at all... and then, the first indication that she would decide the pace and style of this labouring journey came this way... a big gush and release of water. There was some green in the waters and this led to my midwife wanting to check progress.Will and I drove to the birthing unit mostly in silence. Me on hands and feet on the back seat. Will in front, knuckles clenched and jaw tightening more than usual. It was impossible to even say a nice thing to each other although in that moment, I felt the silent affections between us... him wanting to say more, me still willing the baby to turn. I think back to the children at home - they looked so scared and confused. I remember thinking of novels I'd read before about mums being brave for their children; how being brave for the children required super human effort but was also, almost effortless, because immediately she knew it was required to protect them. They had been so excited before we left, singing and dancing 'The baby is coming today!' Yes, the baby is coming today, just not as planned.11am arrival - Karen walks down the short corridor of the birthing facility with determination.A little before 12 the baby is taken from my open body. She's shown to me. She moves across the room without me. Will, as many fathers in this situation feels torn. He goes with her, after I say not to worry about me. I lay there then, my body has expelled nothing, only dignity. Like in death, I imagine, one lay there, hoping for the best, aware that one exists now between a realm of here and there. With a vaginal delivery, I remember so distinctly the feeling of expelling the human. The separation of their body from the home that is (becomes 'was') my body is so distinct and real. The replacement of the person who was homed there for 9 months with a plethora or hormones is a vivid experience. It is alive and active. With the caesarian there was nothing like that. I remember thinking to myself how numb I felt, how absent, how desperate for the hormones - like I imagine one craves a drug. The irony was that I was on lots of drugs. In fact more than I'd ever been perhaps... but I hated every single clear liquid bag chugging into my veins. Into my veins, into the blood, into the milk, into her. I hated the drugs, I hated my body, I felt an indescribable sense of loss. Why!!? I'd seen and heard this many times before - the labour ended in an emergency caesar. Thankfully the baby and mum are safe. All that matters is that they are safe and here and alive. How much of this could I have changed, I still wonder now, to this very moment as I write these words.At home, we had left our forlorn children, our worried nanny and what looked like a crash scene...the people in the crash had been rushed to safety, to get help - physical help, nobody cared for the emotional or mental state of those people. Medicine - to keep you alive. Grateful you're alive, safe, here. I kept re-imagining it as I lay on that gurney after the surgery. The pool had been filled with water, the sun was out. The 3 towels filled with amniotic liquid tinged a little green lay on the wooden floors, some water dripping through onto my husband's makeshift desk downstairs... maybe onto the laptop. At least he has a nice memento - baby's poop in his everyday life. The shimmying of the hips and rolls and breathe... and... lower your shoulders... 'be with the surge', says my doula repeatedly. All these memories lay like carnage in our bedroom. In the aftermath of Zawe's labour I have a photograph of Tau looking at the miracle that was her presence - a 5 am slumber of awe and miracle embodied in her little body. In the aftermath of Sanaa's labour I only see flashes of this scene - abandoned and left behind. I tell her in the car that we are on our way to get her out... that we are coming. I believe she hears me but I don't know if she likes it. It takes us weeks - now day 21 - to start sniffing each other out.On that day - day 1 - on the gurney, nurses come in and out and ask why I'm not asleep.In the drugged slumber/ nightmare, I only think of how they operated AND I wasn't wearing panties. Why was there a need for such openness. I think of the noisy nurses chattering in the background. I see the surgeon's assistant calmly asking after my other two children...I think of Will's face looking at me, telling me it'll all be ok but seeing only terror in his eyes. I think of how I can't remember holding the baby. I remember how every time the nurses entered the room, how they seemed to be scolding that I wasn't asleep but that some part of me was trying to override the morphine to be present, to reach for my baby in that labour realm where her and I knew each other well. I felt drenched in sadness that I couldn't feel for the numbness that overwhelmed every part of me... and her. I stared at her limp little body against my unfeeling one. Nobody told me I'd have to lay here for hours until the anaesthetic wore off. Minutes before being cut open the anaesthetist casually asks about our music choice. I wanted to scream that we had not planned music, that we had not planned THIS! Instead - Kyle Shepherd, Dream state, comes to mind, as I lay there - Jesus on the cross style with my vag and breakfast on display - I hear the sounds of the trio - piano, bass, trumpet... I focus on the instruments. She arrives to the sound of this music and the syncopation that is Jazz... a dream state way of arriving earth side.",

    birthStory:
      "My labour was planned as baby was breech, so it had to be a c-section (I come from a long line of breech babies including me, my brother, and my mom who was delivered by c-section in the 1950s, so it was not a massive surprise). Before it was confirmed that baby was not going to turn, my gynae said it was up to me how I wanted to deliver (I believe this is common in South African private hospitals) and that there were pros and cons to both caesar and vaginal.'They're both shit', I remember her concluding. I was kind of relieved I wasn't given a choice. I was terrified, labelled as a 'mature' mother in my late 30s after having gone through IVF after not falling pregnant naturally for around six years (possibly due to endometriosis), I was made fully aware of all the possible complications and risks at my age. I was aware that I was lucky to have fallen pregnant, for the first time in my life, with only one viable embryo, and after only one cycle of IVF. The whole process felt like a strange and unbelievable lottery of life. I always describe it as both a horror show and a miracle.Going through the c-section, was admittedly horrible in its own way even though it went relatively well and there were no complications. I could see my husband, who is an anaesthetist, was shaking with nerves. My own anaesthetist was lovely and gentle, as was my gynae who had somehow chosen the most incredible playlist, I loved every song, which calmed me (the only one I can remember is Teenage Dirtbag, which although possibly not pertinent theme wise made me incredibly happy). What was perhaps disturbing about the op was that in the light above I could see a reflection of everything happening below. All I saw was blood and organs, literally coming out of me. Once baby was out, I could hear and see a sense of urgency and rush to reassemble my insides, which is probably not exactly what was happening medically but that is how I perceived it. Everyone sang happy birthday and baby was good, and me and husband cried, and I utilised the morphine pump to address the crazy levels of pain and or discomfort I was feeling. This perhaps made thing a bit fuzzy, although I feel I remember that moment pretty well. Because it was deep COVID lockdown, my husband couldn't stay, and I could have no visitors and I was alone with my baby in our own hospital room, which at the time actually did feel like privilege and a blessing. Apart from those first few hours of just taking each other in, things started to go a bit downhill. From the op you can barely move, can't walk, are reliant on sisters for everything. My biggest issue was feeding. I read various books convincing me that I was going to breast feed no matter what. It was definitely the best way, I had decided. I didn't even research bottle feeding, I had no intention of doing it. It was, to this day, the hardest thing I ever tried to do. Compounded with the pain of the op, the pain of breastfeeding was indescribable, literally blood and pus and bruising.This was with the acknowledgement that I would need help and guidance, employing a lactation consultant who came to see me in the hospital room. After leaving the hospital, being at home for two days and going to my first paed visit, I was readmitted to hospital with a baby whose weight had dropped dangerously low and whose bilirubin scores were alarmingly high, due to feeding issues.

I've never felt like such a failure, I was struggling to keep my first and only child alive, after all my struggling to even fall pregnant.

Through the night I had to wake up every 1.5 hours to use the hospital pump, and when I didn't pump enough they scolded me for messing up my schedule. I had the worst never-ending headache, was the most sleep-deprived I had ever been in my life, was swollen, bleeding and in pain from the op, and it sounds dramatic, but at points I wasn't sure I was able to survive the physical and emotional pain.
