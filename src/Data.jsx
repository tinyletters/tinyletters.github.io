      "My labour was planned as baby was breach, so it had to be a c-section (I come from a long line of breach babies including me, my brother, and my mom who was delivered by c-section in the 1950s, so it was not a massive surprise). Before it was confirmed that baby was not going to turn, my gynae said it was up to me how I wanted to deliver (I believe this is common in South African private hospitals) and that there were pros and cons to both caesar and vaginal.",

    birthStory:
      "Leaving the house was a very dramatic affair. I'd had two physical examinations - Karen checked once, after my water had broken in the passage - a big, gushing whoosh of release. I laughed, in my hot pink workout top and blue sarong around my hips. After my waters broke I abandoned the kikoy. I remember how in each pregnancy there's a moment that you forget your body for being a living thing that can be made pretty or fresher or lovelier or anything at all beyond a labouring body. My waters had never broken before - in the first labour, my midwife broke it and because I was already a few hours into labour (and laying down if I remember correctly), I didn't feel much. With the second one, she came with the waters! With this one, I wasn't expecting the waters at all... and then, the first indication that she would decide the pace and style of this labouring journey came this way... a big gush and release of water. There was some green in the waters and this led to my midwife wanting to check progress.",
