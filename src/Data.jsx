    birthStory: "My daughter was at least one week overdue (I don't remember exactly how many days, but I remember I was sick of going back to the ob-gyn every day). My first child was also a couple of days late, so I didn't worry, but because she felt so much bigger and heavier, I was very ready for this pregnancy to be over. The first signs of labour started in the early morning, but I was determined to stay at home as long as possible. I was in a good mood all morning, listening to music, dancing and breathing through the contractions. When the pain became worse and the contractions got closer to each other, my husband and I drove to the hospital. I remember cursing his old car because I felt every bump on the road and it made the pain of contractions just so much worse. We had to wait for a little bit before going into the labour room and all throughout I was convinced I would give birth on the bench in the waiting room. Luckily, that didn't happen and when I was admitted into the labour room, there were two midwife students who offered to massage my back to try and help me to relax. I had arranged with the hospital staff beforehand that I would like to not have any aditus (I'm very afraid of needles), so for the most part, the medical staff let me labour in peace. As with my first labour, my water didn't break until the very end. My daughter was born shortly after and I felt so amazed by the fact that this (not quite so) tiny human being was my baby. \n The time at the hospital was strange. I was used to having my then four-year old son around, and being alone with my daughter, who still slept so much, I felt like I was in a different world. When my husband brought our son to visit the first time, I was really nervous. And when my parents-in-law came, I just wanted to be somewhere else. The first weeks at home were hard. I was constantly tired (so tired even my midwife noticed and it turned out I had lost too much blood and was suffering from severe iron deficiency...), nursing did not go as easily as it had done with my first child and, although I had always found comfort in nursing, I now started to dread it. Every time my daughter latched pain shot through my entire body and I had to suppress tears so many times. Somehow everything seemed so much harder than the first time around, I felt lonely a lot. My husband was out and about, my son was at kindergarten, and I was stuck on the sofa with a baby sleeping on top of me. After a while, I slowly found my groove and tried to make the most of the fact that I couldn't leave the sofa (at least I could read) – and then the first Covid lockdown shut down Germany and our life was turned upside down. Strangely I was glad nobody was going to be able to visit, we were cooped up at home and I no longer felt quite so alone. The one thing I still remember so clearly was thinking 'how could I have forgotten how painful this is?'. The labour itself – at least the part taking place at the hospital –  was relatively brief, but that one thought stuck with me. The first days with my daughter I spent at the hospital (in Germany it's common to stay there for at least two to three days, no matter if it was a vaginal or cesarean birth) and often just waited for the days to pass. I read a lot while my daughter slept peacefully. The nurses were at first hesitant about her sleeping in my bed, but they soon helped me build a little nest so we could snuggle all night and breastfeed without me having to lift her out of her cot all the time. I was glad to be home afterwards, but suddenly my son felt so big and everything at home felt different. My midwife was going to come check on me in regular intervals. Initially, it worked really well, but then the covid lockdown at the end of March in Germany brought that to a stop. She still came by, but couldn't come into the apartment for the most part and so there was less intense care as with my first child. My husband was very supportive throughout the labour and he tried to be the first weeks after birth, but work kept him busy so I often felt a bit alone in the first weeks at home. I was a graduate student pursuing a Master's degree when I had my daughter. I had finished most of my course work and 'only' needed to write my master's thesis. I also worked as a freelance journalist, but could take two months off. Afterwards, I only started with a couple of hours and could work entirely from home. It took me almost another two years to finish my master's thesis. Now I'm a research assistant and PhD student. Although my supervisor and boss is very understanding and supportive, I would say the general work environment in academia is not very family friendly. I'm not quite sure when exactly I felt 'like myself' again (do I even feel like myself again?). I think when I made the decision to start dancing again and attend dance class (when my daughter was almost three), I felt like I'm regaining a sense of myself again. Also, when I had to travel to Belgium for a conference and I got to spend a couple of days on my own, I felt like I'm on the journey to rediscovering myself again.",

    birthStory:
      "Against all odds / channel the fire dragon - sharing this for the wild ones - I know it’s not for everyone but to me it was so important. Wrote this in the first few weeks after my child was born. The last few weeks to the birth of my son were intense in several ways, not only was I nursing a sick toddler, I was also fighting for my desired birth plan and autonomy. This time round I really wanted a home birth especially considering that first time round I was convinced not to by the end and induced at 42+ weeks ( not because there were any issues - simply because policy says induction at 42 weeks). I wanted to birth in the love and comfort of my home, with my family, my way this time, with no induction, no pain meds - just natural, so midway through this pregnancy I changed midwives to a midwife who supposedly still did home births because my previous one no longer did them due to insurance policy. This upset me quite a bit, but I got on with it and went with a midwife that came recommended for home births - this also meant I had to change back up gynae. Fast track to 30 weeks I go meet the back up gynae. Everything goes well. My placenta is in. The front this time around. Scans are perfect - both this pregnancy and my last were uncomplicated, low risk etc. fast track again to 36 weeks and I am told my placenta is “prematurely calcifying” and will have to go for an additional scan 2 weeks later to determine “the rate at which it is calcifying” which will then determine whether I am “allowed” to home birth / birth naturally and or need to be induced or possibly scheduled for C-section. I’m told I won’t be allowed to carry on over 40 weeks regardless. I’m told this all quite flippantly by the gynae and it hits me in the chest like a ton of bricks. Something just doesn’t *feel right* about all of this. My intuition says “No”. I know I’m healthy, I know my body. I’m also told I am low risk presenting no other issues or complications whatsoever so why would a calcifying placenta (which is meant to happen towards the end of pregnancy) warrant this intervention? I do my own research, get second opinions and way up the risks. I decide not to go for the additional scan at 38 weeks as the logical conclusion would be that the placenta is calcifying - I know this already - and so continue with my birth plan for natural home birth. Come towards the end of 39 weeks my midwife asks if I have the go ahead from gynae for natural birth. After that conversation I suddenly realize I am caught in a whole system of what is medical policy etc etc etc and told if I don’t go for another scan I will not have the support of back up gynae which then ties the hands of midwife and puts her license at risk. I’m told with a calcified placenta, medical policy says induction at 39 weeks - standard 🤯 oh! Right… I forgot about the legal implications of me wanting to give birth to my child in the best way I believe. I forgot that this wasn’t about my body and my baby and birth... it dawned on me that I was up against a mountain of fear mongering of medical policy. Having had a traumatic induced birth first time around I was feeling particularly sensitive to being pushed into something for no legitimate cause for concern. I agreed to go for another scan and as I expected - everything was developing healthy and fine with baby,. he had enough oxygen, enough amniotic fluid, showing no signs of distress, growing well - big and strong etc. the only “concern” was a “calcifying placenta” - which happens naturally at the end of pregnancy to signal the body to go into natural labour! Everything in me said “No, trust YOUR body, trust your mother instinct”. Due to the case of the placenta and me asking to be allowed to continue for natural birth, the gynae refused to support my birth. This freaked out my midwife. So I scheduled another meeting with the gynae which I had to pay for! I convinced her to support me and give me another week till 41 weeks (Friday 17th) and offered to sign a disclaimer and state that I was taking the risk and wouldn’t hold anyone else responsible if anything were to go wrong. I negotiate to have my birth at Genesis ( now no longer because apparently it wasn’t making enough profit for Life Hospitals as a natural birthing home) instead of home for THEIR peace of mind. They revoked their threat and and agreed to support my birth. A few days go by and by the Wednesday (40 weeks and 6 days) I am 3mm dilated, Braxton Hicks have been appearing for the last week every day and continuing into the evening- I KNOW natural labour is imminent and just need to be left in peace and calm. But I’m not given this peace and calm. Thursday arrives just shy of 41 weeks. I’m asked by my midwife to come in for an NST at midday. I go - my midwife send the results to the gynae and checks with the other nurse on duty. The other midwives and nurses say the reading is fine but the gynae gets back to her and says they’re not happy with the reading - they want a repeat NST in another hour and I’m told to bring my hospital bags in case. “In case of what?” I question. I’m told because they want to induce labour and possibly go into theatre - I’m told the gynae has a scheduled c-section at 8pm, so she can do me after that… that’s what will be convenient for her. I am angry and I am scared because I know this is not about my birth and my child and about their schedule. The midwife seems not to have my back and is being completely compliant with the Tyne’s requests. I go home and meditate to center myself and calm my anger and prepare for the induction. I speak to my doula and she says - we will do what we can but it’s clear theyre going to do everything they can to get you to c section. I Channel the fire dragon 🐉. I’m a big believer in harnessing your animal power in times of need. In my previous birth it was the elephant- this time fire dragon came to me. I was raging and I was going to use that to bring my baby into the world. I surfaced from my center still determined for natural birth with no other intervention, no pain meds, pure. I prepare my toddler whom I’ve never spent a night away from and tell him what is going on - that I will be home tomorrow with his baby brother - I’m getting in and out of Genesis as fast as possible. My mom is home to stay with him. My husband and I leave and I feel like I’m leaving for battle with a united force with my husband and my doula by my side. I negotiate with my midwife to take the cytotec in small doses instead of one big whack as in the previous birth. I take the first half dose of cytotec at 4pm. My doula arrives and we chat, keep the mood light and uplifted despite the situation and tensions with the midwife and gynae. I stick up some loving letters that were written to me by other mothers, some motivational mantras, and a picture of an elephant and a paper star I made for my baby onto the wall. I’m moving swaying from side to side legs open, connecting with my baby - telling him we are bringing him into the world now. The candles are on and I have my stones which give me strength, put my music on with the sounds of the bush ( where I feel most at peace) and throat singing meditations. I do my pelvic stretches, cat and cow, squats, open hands, open throat, throat singing in a low deep tone - all things I learnt from Shasta and her birth course. I sing the songs I have sung to my baby all through pregnancy connecting our heart lines. We are about to embark on his birth journey that I have fought for and protected as best as I can. I am 6cm dilated by 6pm and take the second dose. Gentle Contractions started already going as they had the days before around 4pm. I sway and breathe through them. We get another update from the gynae around 7pm - c-section scheduled for 9pm. The midwife says to me I have until then to birth naturally otherwise I’m going into theatre - all through this the baby’s heart rate is absolutely fine and no concern - there isn’t even an oxygen tank in the birthing room. I start shaking uncontrollably in shock. I look to my doula who safeguarded my birth like a true birth keeper woman. She reassures me we can do this, calmly and lovingly. My husband goes to speak to the midwife privately and tells me he hold her that he said to her “my wife does not want a c section. If there is no true medical emergency for this, why is she being pressured into it? What can you do to help her have the natural birth?”. They come back in and the midwife breaks my waters to move the process quickly along and the contractions start in force. I breathe deeply in and lion’s breath out. I now am channeling the fire dragon in full force breathing into the bottom of my rib cage and out with a low throat opening groan - I do this throughout the birthing- opening my cervix, opening wide. With each contraction I vocalise the opening of the throat, open hands open leg squatting. First on the bed then I move off the bed to the floor. All through this in my mind I feel the fear, the pain but I vocalise to myself- “ I am capable, I am opening wide open. I am soft. I am getting huge. I’ve got this, we’ve got this baby, we  are bring you earth side, work with me! ” I talk to him directly visualising him coming down and always a golden cord from his heart and mine. Soon after getting onto the floor I feel the urge to push. I keep talking to myself and baby. The only other voice I am focused on is my doula- her every word of encouragement motivates me. Each contraction pain makes me feel like I should give up and go to the knife, but her words keep me going. I can do this. I can hear my husband reassure me every now and then- this opens my heart releases more oxytocin. I use all of this to open up. With my legs split in squatting position I reach down to touch myself and feel myself opening, to feel my baby, I caress my vagina to my thighs telling myself I am opening wide open, getting huge!. I tell baby to come into the world. We are ready. I push, I can feel it coming close. Midwife suggests a position change. I turn around and have my husband on the bed behind me holding me up and I push while breathing the fire dragon imagining my heart opening my whole birth passage opening. I can feel the burning and I know it’s close - we are there. I push again and I can feel baby’s head come out. I wait for a moment for the next contraction to push the rest of baby out. Finally. We are there. I open my eyes I hear him scream. I take him into my arms. He is perfect. It took about 3 pushes to get him out. From induced active labour to birth it took 1h45 +- minutes- I birthed at 9:22pm. I don’t know how we managed to go so quickly but having the deadline of a c-section sure put the pressure on. This is a testament to mind power, to trusting the body, connecting body mind and heart - it can be done. No tears to my vagina and a perfectly healthy baby at 3.79kgs 55cm long and a marginally calcified placenta. We did it against all odds. I am eternally grateful to my doula and husband for protecting me in my most vulnerable moment and helping through this passage of birth, giving my son his right to natural birth.  This is not to say c-sections don’t have a place in saving a baby and mother but it didn’t have a legitimate place in my case and I am grateful we trusted that instinct and didn’t give into the pressure just because of what is medical policy. It was the middle of winter and bloody cold. We spent the rest of the night at Genisis, and when the sun rose we got home as quickly as we could. I just wanted to be home, with my first child, my dogs, my mom and my husband and new baby. I cocooned him in our room. This time around I had the intention to take the 6 week ( 4th trimester) seriously. With my first birth I thought I could just carry on as previously before pregnancy and birth and I exhausted myself completely as a result. I tried to do better for myself and baby this time around. I ate the right foods to replenish my body and milk production. I didn’t see anyone and stalled the visitors for as long as possible. It was so cold that I would spend most of the day cuddling in bed with warmth all around us. The adjustment was hard for his brother. I was quite neurotic about him coming close to his new born brother when he was sick. We had made the mistake of starting school with my first child and he was catching every single bug and bringing it home to his brother. In retrospect I wish I just let him be home with both of us and we could have all cocooned together. But part of me also just wanted me and my newborn to get to know one another. My 6 week check up with the midwife was very tense. She was sheepish and asked me how the birth was for me. I was still angry and couldn’t really speak to her. I just remarked that thank god I fought for what I wanted and my baby is completely perfect, growing healthy- she agreed. I feel for midwives in South Africa. The medical industry doesn’t support them or make it easy to do their job. Or at least in the private sector. Its so frustrating. Use c sections where they are truly needed! I wish the midwife had the end say and not the gynaecologist because it makes their predicament so much more complicated having to please both mother and gynae. When they really should be able to be the one to make the call. In my case it was so clear to me that the gynae was bullying the midwife. Anyways moving on. The first 6 weeks were a little pressured even though I tried my best to take it easy and relax- I was completing my masters thesis and had been awarded the social impact art prize and suddenly had to do the project before the end of year, so was quickly whipped into working. I feel like my baby and I had perhaps 2 weeks of quiet and calm “maternity leave” and from then on he had to join me to work most days since birth. There was one moment when my project I was working on was at crunch time and he got sick, it was like he was begging me to stop working and just be with him, that the separation was too much, even if it were just a few hours a day. I’ve been the busiest I’ve been in a career since his birth and perhaps as a result he’s a lot more compliant to 'go with the flow'.",

      "Fast track to 30 weeks I go meet the back up gynae. Everything goes well. My placenta is in. The front this time around.",
      "Scans are perfect - both this pregnancy and my last were uncomplicated, low risk etc.",
      "Fast track again to 36 weeks and I am told my placenta is 'prematurely calcifying' and will have to go for an additional scan 2 weeks later to determine 'the rate at which it is calcifying' which will then determine whether I am 'allowed' to home birth / birth naturally and or need to be induced or possibly scheduled for C-section.",
      "I’m told I won’t be allowed to carry on over 40 weeks regardless. I’m told this all quite flippantly by the gynae and it hits me in the chest like a ton of bricks.",
      "Something just doesn’t *feel right* about all of this. My intuition says 'No'. I know I’m healthy, I know my body.",
      "I’m also told I am low risk presenting no other issues or complications whatsoever so why would a calcifying placenta (which is meant to happen towards the end of pregnancy) warrant this intervention?",
      "I do my own research, get second opinions and weigh up the risks.",
      "I decide not to go for the additional scan at 38 weeks as the logical conclusion would be that the placenta is calcifying - I know this already - and so continue with my birth plan for natural home birth.",
      "Come towards the end of 39 weeks my midwife asks if I have the go ahead from gynae for natural birth.",
      "After that conversation I suddenly realise I am caught in a whole system of what is medical policy etc etc etc and told if I don’t go for another scan I will not have the support of back up gynae which then ties the hands of midwife and puts her license at risk.",
      "I’m told with a calcified placenta, medical policy says induction at 39 weeks - standard 🤯.",
      "Oh! Right… I forgot about the legal implications of me wanting to give birth to my child in the best way I believe.",
      "I forgot that this wasn’t about my body and my baby and birth... it dawned on me that I was up against a mountain of fear mongering of medical policy.",
      "Having had a traumatic induced birth first time around I was feeling particularly sensitive to being pushed into something for no legitimate cause for concern.",
      "I agreed to go for another scan and as I expected - everything was developing healthy and fine with baby, he had enough oxygen, enough amniotic fluid, showing no signs of distress, growing well - big and strong etc.",
      "The only 'concern' was a 'calcifying placenta' - which happens naturally at the end of pregnancy to signal the body to go into natural labour!",
      "Everything in me said 'No, trust YOUR body, trust your mother instinct'.",
      "Due to the case of the placenta and me asking to be allowed to continue for natural birth, the gynae refused to support my birth. This freaked out my midwife. So I scheduled another meeting with the gynae which I had to pay for! I convinced her to support me and give me another week till 41 weeks (Friday 17th) and offered to sign a disclaimer and state that I was taking the risk and wouldn’t hold anyone else responsible if anything were to go wrong.",
      "I negotiate to have my birth at Genesis (now no longer because apparently it wasn’t making enough profit for Life Hospitals as a natural birthing home) instead of home for THEIR peace of mind. They revoked their threat and agreed to support my birth.",
      "A few days go by and by the Wednesday (40 weeks and 6 days) I am 3mm dilated, Braxton Hicks have been appearing for the last week every day and continuing into the evening - I KNOW natural labour is imminent and just need to be left in peace and calm.",
      "But I’m not given this peace and calm. Thursday arrives just shy of 41 weeks.",
      "I’m asked by my midwife to come in for an NST at midday. I go - my midwife sends the results to the gynae and checks with the other nurse on duty.",
      "The other midwives and nurses say the reading is fine but the gynae gets back to her and says they’re not happy with the reading - they want a repeat NST in another hour and I’m told to bring my hospital bags in case. 'In case of what?' I question. I’m told because they want to induce labour and possibly go into theatre - I’m told the gynae has a scheduled C-section at 8pm, so she can do me after that… that’s what will be convenient for her.",
      "I am angry and I am scared because I know this is not about my birth and my child and about their schedule.",
      "The midwife seems not to have my back and is being completely compliant with the gynae’s requests.",
      "I go home and meditate to center myself and calm my anger and prepare for the induction.",
      "I speak to my doula and she says - we will do what we can but it’s clear they’re going to do everything they can to get you to C-section.",
      "I channel the fire dragon 🐉. I’m a big believer in harnessing your animal power in times of need. In my previous birth it was the elephant - this time the fire dragon came to me.",
      "I was raging and I was going to use that to bring my baby into the world.",
      "I surfaced from my center still determined for natural birth with no other intervention, no pain meds, pure.",
      "I prepare my toddler whom I’ve never spent a night away from and tell him what is going on - that I will be home tomorrow with his baby brother - I’m getting in and out of Genesis as fast as possible. My mom is home to stay with him.",
      "My husband and I leave and I feel like I’m leaving for battle with a united force with my husband and my doula by my side.",
      "I negotiate with my midwife to take the cytotec in small doses instead of one big whack as in the previous birth. I take the first half dose of cytotec at 4pm.",
      "My doula arrives and we chat, keep the mood light and uplifted despite the situation and tensions with the midwife and gynae.",
      "I stick up some loving letters that were written to me by other mothers, some motivational mantras, and a picture of an elephant and a paper star I made for my baby onto the wall.",
      "I’m moving, swaying from side to side, legs open, connecting with my baby - telling him we are bringing him into the world now.",
      "The candles are on and I have my stones which give me strength, put my music on with the sounds of the bush (where I feel most at peace) and throat singing meditations.",
      "I do my pelvic stretches, cat and cow, squats, open hands, open throat, throat singing in a low deep tone - all things I learnt from Shasta and her birth course.",
      "I sing the songs I have sung to my baby all through pregnancy connecting our heart lines.",
      "We are about to embark on his birth journey that I have fought for and protected as best as I can.",
      "I am 6cm dilated by 6pm and take the second dose.",
      "Gentle contractions started already going as they had the days before around 4pm. I sway and breathe through them.",
      "We get another update from the gynae around 7pm - C-section scheduled for 9pm. The midwife says to me I have until then to birth naturally otherwise I’m going into theatre - all through this the baby’s heart rate is absolutely fine and no concern - there isn’t even an oxygen tank in the birthing room.",
      "I start shaking uncontrollably in shock. I look to my doula who safeguarded my birth like a true birth keeper woman. She reassures me we can do this, calmly and lovingly.",
      "My husband goes to speak to the midwife privately and tells me he told her 'my wife does not want a C-section. If there is no true medical emergency for this, why is she being pressured into it? What can you do to help her have the natural birth?'",
      "They come back in and the midwife breaks my waters to move the process quickly along and the contractions start in force. I breathe deeply in and lion’s breath out.",
      "I now am channeling the fire dragon in full force, breathing into the bottom of my rib cage and out with a low throat-opening groan. I do this throughout the birthing - opening my cervix, opening wide.",
      "With each contraction I vocalise the opening of the throat, open hands, open legs squatting. First on the bed then I move off the bed to the floor.",
      "All through this in my mind I feel the fear, the pain but I vocalise to myself - 'I am capable, I am opening wide open. I am soft. I am getting huge. I’ve got this, we’ve got this baby, we are bringing you earth side, work with me!'.",
      "I talk to him directly visualising him coming down and always a golden cord from his heart and mine.",
      "Soon after getting onto the floor I feel the urge to push. I keep talking to myself and baby.",
      "The only other voice I am focused on is my doula - her every word of encouragement motivates me.",
      "Each contraction pain makes me feel like I should give up and go to the knife, but her words keep me going. I can do this.",
      "I can hear my husband reassure me every now and then - this opens my heart releases more oxytocin.",
      "I use all of this to open up. With my legs split in squatting position I reach down to touch myself and feel myself opening, to feel my baby, I caress my vagina to my thighs telling myself I am opening wide open, getting huge!.",
      "I tell baby to come into the world. We are ready. I push, I can feel it coming close.",
      "Midwife suggests a position change. I turn around and have my husband on the bed behind me holding me up and I push while breathing the fire dragon imagining my heart opening my whole birth passage opening.",
      "I can feel the burning and I know it’s close - we are there. I push again and I can feel baby’s head come out.",
      "I wait for a moment for the next contraction to push the rest of baby out.",
      "Finally. We are there. I open my eyes I hear him scream. I take him into my arms. He is perfect.",
      "It took about 3 pushes to get him out. From induced active labour to birth it took 1h45 +- minutes- I birthed at 9:22pm.",
      "I don’t know how we managed to go so quickly but having the deadline of a C-section sure put the pressure on.",
      "This is a testament to mind power, to trusting the body, connecting body mind and heart - it can be done.",
      "No tears to my vagina and a perfectly healthy baby at 3.79kgs 55cm long and a marginally calcified placenta. We did it against all odds.",
      "I am eternally grateful to my doula and husband for protecting me in my most vulnerable moment and helping through this passage of birth, giving my son his right to natural birth.",
      "This is not to say C-sections don’t have a place in saving a baby and mother but it didn’t have a legitimate place in my case and I am grateful we trusted that instinct and didn’t give into the pressure just because of what is medical policy.",
      "It was the middle of winter and bloody cold. We spent the rest of the night at Genisis, and when the sun rose we got home as quickly as we could.",
      "I just wanted to be home, with my first child, my dogs, my mom and my husband and new baby. I cocooned him in our room.",
      "This time around I had the intention to take the 6 week (4th trimester) seriously. With my first birth I thought I could just carry on as previously before pregnancy and birth and I exhausted myself completely as a result.",
      "I tried to do better for myself and baby this time around. I ate the right foods to replenish my body and milk production. I didn’t see anyone and stalled the visitors for as long as possible.",
      "It was so cold that I would spend most of the day cuddling in bed with warmth all around us.",
      "The adjustment was hard for his brother. I was quite neurotic about him coming close to his new born brother when he was sick.",
      "We had made the mistake of starting school with my first child and he was catching every single bug and bringing it home to his brother. In retrospect I wish I just let him be home with both of us and we could have all cocooned together. But part of me also just wanted me and my newborn to get to know one another.",
      "My 6 week check up with the midwife was very tense. She was sheepish and asked me how the birth was for me. I was still angry and couldn’t really speak to her. I just remarked that thank god I fought for what I wanted and my baby is completely perfect, growing healthy - she agreed.",
      "I feel for midwives in South Africa. The medical industry doesn’t support them or make it easy to do their job. Or at least in the private sector. Its so frustrating.",
      "Use C-sections where they are truly needed! I wish the midwife had the end say and not the gynaecologist because it makes their predicament so much more complicated having to please both mother and gynae. When they really should be able to be the one to make the call.",
      "In my case it was so clear to me that the gynae was bullying the midwife. Anyways moving on.",

    birthOnly: `Against all odds / channel the fire dragon - sharing this for the wild ones - I know it’s not for everyone but to me it was so important. Wrote this in the first few weeks after my child was born. \nThe last few weeks to the birth of my son were intense in several ways, not only was I nursing a sick toddler, I was also fighting for my desired birth plan and autonomy.

    birthStory:
      "It was a planned C-section at a time when COVID was setting in. It was lonely, as no family members could travel due COVID restrictions. There is a weird sense of unpreparedness and uncertainty. My husband was asked to leave within an hour of delivery. He could only come back on the day of discharge. To navigate all the newness completely alone was quite a thing. It took us about 30 minutes in the theatre after the epidural. The doctors were extremely chatty, with each other. Discussing other cases etc etc. Did not make it look like anything. I don't know to feel about it. Felt a lot of pressure/thrust at one point. Soon they exclaimed, 'it's a girl', lots of black hair, eh?! My husband looked very flushed and in a trance the whole time until he saw his daughter. He was soon rushed along other doctors for primary check up of the child. I remember shivering rigorously in the recovery room. Being back on the bed, I still couldn't feel my lower body. Suddenly realised the nurse came to change the bedding. In looking I saw a huge patch of blood on the sheet. At that very point, making everything look like a part of the process I was asked to let my new born latch. At that very point, I realised one of core aspects of parenting. To keep at it, no matter what. What followed ever since, is a practical living lesson of this first learning of motherhood. [I didn't have the baby] blues exactly. Felt very overwhelmed for sure. Nothing [was in place for me as a new mother]. It was just the two of us trying to navigate. No family, did not have a community of friends here at that point.",

    birthOnly: `It was a planned C-section at a time when covid was setting in. It was lonely, as no family members could travel due covid restrictions. There is a weird sense of unpreparedness and uncertainty. My husband was asked to leave within an hour of delivery. He could only come back on the day if discharge. To navigate all the newness completely alone was quite a thing. It took us about 30 minutes in the theatre after the epidural. The doctors were extremely chatty, with each other. Discussing other cases etc etc. Did not make it look like anything. I don't know how to feel about it. Felt a lot of pressure/ thrust at one point. Soon they exclaimed, 'it's a girl', lots of black hair, eh?! My husband looked very flushed and in a trance the whole time until he saw his daughter. He was soon rushed along by other doctors for primary check up of the child. I remember shivering rigorously in the recovery room. Being back on the bed, I couldn't still feel my lower body. Suddenly realised the nurse came to change the bedding. In looking I saw a huge patch of blood on the sheet.

    birthStory:
      "I wanted a VBAC because I never got the experience of birthing a baby first time round. My overarching feelings are of regret because I never got to experience labour like other people do. I never got to give birth. In reality that is not what I felt at the time. I felt helpless and panicked before and during the birth. I was threatened with sedation if I did not calm down. It was my second caesar, and I hate the whole experience of being pushed and pulled and no one tells you what is happening. And this was worse because I never even got to hold my baby. They worked on her and would not allow her to lie on me, I could not ask what was going on for fear of disturbing their work and there was a shift change so no nurses came to relieve the paed. I was numb and could not move, it felt like a very long time. I think I was a bit mentally numb due to panic, I could not think so just lay there suspended in this state but without actually feeling. I think I have forgotten a lot of how it felt now. First 6 weeks were hell. Even past the hospital time we then had to force feed her with a bottle. She was not able to breast feed. But pumping was hell. We got specialist midwives to come and help us learn how to bottle feed her because she would just scream when we tried. We closeted ourselves away from everyone and everything and just pumped and force fed her in cycles of 2 to 3 hours. I kept a notebook with all the volumes she drank to make sure she was getting enough and weighed her obsessively. I slept in the same chair I pumped in and forgot to shower. I only ate because I had food brought to me. My son had the roughest time because his mother was suddenly unable to care for him and I could not cope with him being loud or boisterous in the room while I was pumping (too little) so I felt like a failure on both fronts. I will always regret not handling that better. [During labour I felt] helpless, like we were sliding toward the inevitable because labour did not progress. I needed information and plans of action but got none from midwife. Was told just to wait it out. [I had] difficulties breast feeding so had to pump – was extremely hard coupled with usual exhaustion. I have diastasis recti and have to have surgery to rectify but it's costly. I just never got my body back. [During the first week I remember] hospital, Ubering back and forth with milk because they keep your baby but kick you out! Guilt for allowing them to keep her from being held. Guilt for not pumping enough and for leaving the hospital at all to go sleep. Tree fell on the driveway in the middle of all this and I was unreasonably panicked about getting there with the milk! I actually got more sleep without baby at home. At the end of this week we got to hold her but it was just so scary and difficult that I am not sure I got the full pleasure one normally gets out of that. [My post-partum support was my] husband. Not entirely as he was just in the same situation as me really. But he did wake first and wash bottles then wake me to pump and it helped. [I returned to work] – mining company head office. Various elements at play here. Pumping was supported correctly. High-pressure job but once COVID hit we had time together and only recently returned to office more than once a week. Got lucky. I now have to travel and being pushed for more so less support the older they get. [I felt myself emerge again after] we did a milestone visit to restaurant for older brother's sake at 2 months. He was only 4 and had a rough time so we took him out with baby. Spent 1.5 hour at closest restaurant with playground and felt so victorious. Wild times. Overall, I I think this happened very slowly. I do know what you mean because I had this first time round. But this was gradual and I hid at home for maternity leave. Possibly just happy to be able to feed baby and cherishing the time because the start was rough. I don't have specific time but more like a series of steps that incrementally got me there.",

    birthStory:
      "My oldest was born in 2018. He was 10 days overdue and after fully preparing for natural birth with hypnobirthing I ended up having an emergency C-section. I was absolutely ready as can be for birth, but with each day that passed I felt no dropping and no pain at all. I was as comfortable as ever at 41 weeks walking around waterfront Harbour. I was induced at 40 weeks+ 10 days. I went into the midwife birthing hospital at 8pm in the evening where I was induced and slept for the night. The next morning I was made comfortable and the day began. My water still hadn't broken by 8pm and the midwife assisted. Still nothing, but once I turned to get up and pee I felt a warm wuuush. I was relieved and believed at this point things would pick up. The contractions became more and more intense. Most of the day was a blur of focus, bouncing on a ball and eating watermelon. I remember the Dr coming in now and then asking about if I requested analgesics, I did not. I was in the zone. The contractions were coming hard and fast but I was not dilating. I remember he midwife told me to climb some light stairs. At this point contractions were fast and I was getting nausea from the pain on the stairs. I went back and had only dilated 2 cm. The midwife recommended the c-section assuming that my son's neck was a bit stuck, but he was fine and not in any stress. I was quite scared with the process that happened next. It all happened fast and did not allow me the same space and peace I was looking forward to, but everyone was very kind and gentle. I was the only patient in the hospital so that was strange but also welcomed, no mania, no panic and no sharing staff. The anaethetist was lovely. She made me feel calm and relaxed despite knowing I was getting a huge spinal injection. Years later we found out that lovely lady died in a car accident soon after my son's birth. The pushing on my stomach to get the baby out was very strange and a bit painful (a lot of pressure), but once I heard the crying I forgot about the entire 24 hours. Our blessing arrived, on his own time. My recovery is an uncommon story. I got an infection in my cut soon after my first gynae check up. Carting a new born to a hospital every day for more than a week for a wound to be drained,hearing his screaming outside the room for me was horrible. I wish that experience on no mother. Trying to recover and comfort a newborn who I didn't even fully understand yet was torture. I never fully understood what kind of rest and recovery a c section needed, I should have taken it slower. I knew better for the next one. After that I could properly heal. I remember pain but can't quite quantity it. [The first week was] quiet quiet quiet, no sleep – that was weird, getting used to a big sleep interruption that like. You never can understand it unless you go through it. Baby struggled to latch the entire first 2 weeks, his weight dropped more than usual. It was... something else. Husband and mom [were post partum support]. Enough support, not overwhelming. I was let go during maternity leave from my work contract. It was not renewed. I freelance. In hind sight it was a blessing to get more time. It was close to 2 years [before I felt myself emerge]. I just remember the feeling of being more me.",

Baby struggled to latch the entire first 2 weeks, his weight dropped more than usual. It was... something else. \n My recovery is an uncommon story. I got an infection in my cut soon after my first gynae check up. Carting a new born to a hospital every day for more than a week for a wound to be drained,hearing his screaming outside the room for me was horrible. I wish that experience on no mother. Trying to recover and comfort a newborn who I didn't even fully understand yet was torture. I never fully understood what kind of rest and recovery a c section needed, I should have taken it slower. I knew better for the next one.\n After that I could properly heal. \n Husband and mom [were post partum support]. Enough support, not overwhelming. \n I was let go during maternity leave from my work contract. It was not renewed . I freelance. In hind sight it was a blessing to get more time. \n It was close to 2 years [before I felt myself emerge]. I just remember the feeling of being more me.

      "My daughter’s birth was a surprise, but a beautiful one. I was supposed to have a caesarean but she arrived early so I gave birth naturally, relying completely on the inherent wisdom of the female body. I breathed through it, drew on inner strength and it was truly a magical experience. I felt I had to take charge of the situation as the doctor was in a state, it was the midst of Covid, and my husband was fearful of natural birth. Because I hadn’t expected a natural childbirth I didn’t expect any sensations nor any consequences of the birth. In retrospect I am glad for this, however, I realise that knowledge is power with child birth and ensure the safety and health of mother and child. I felt like the bottom of my body was falling out! But I also felt calm and in control. I breathed a lot - as if meditating - to keep the baby calm and help her enter the world peacefully.The first 40 days were tricky - my husband was supportive but not as I had imagined. I also still had to work. It was all a bit surreal, looking back! I would have more [children] if I were significantly younger! [The first week was] A juggle! But peaceful. Trying to figure out what to do, and settling into what it means to have a baby. My husband helped a bit but I don’t think it was I really needed. I don’t have any other support. I was also still working. I am thankful I have good health and am strong, so was able to pull it together and make it work. I hope to be around for my daughter if she has children so I can be there for her. I am a consultant so no work – no pay… It was a long time after [that I felt myself emerge]… maybe close to 3 plus years! Then I started to see glimmers of my old self.

    birthStory:
      "I gave birth in the middle of the storm that is COVID. I was alone – husband was not allowed – restrictions. It was night time when my contractions started – after timing them for an hour, I was convinced that it was time. Without night time driving permits, my husband took me to the hospital which was an hour and 30 minutes away.  When we got there, I had to endure a COVID test done while I was twisting and turning from a painful contraction. The nurse on call was not very happy to see me – she was irritable and very short with me (maybe she had a long day). But she kept calling me Sisi. That was really annoying me. But I didn't want to escalate an already tense situation. She initially thought I wasn't in labour, she kept asking me if I was sure, but in a very sarcastic manner. I decided not to match her energy. Fast forward to a while later, I am admitted – she had satisfied her requirements, which included sticking what felt like her whole arm inside my vagina while I was having a contraction. I spent most of the night twisting and rolling on the bed, walking about in the corridors, pushing through the floods of painful contractions. I endure, I think about my baby boy, I breath in and out, like how they show you on those YouTube videos. Now and again, the nurses check if all is in order – its almost the break of dawn. I remember thinking how this time tomorrow, i'll be having my baby and all of this will be behind me. The time comes, I am fully dilated and ready for the next phase - they make me walk to the birthing ward – I am tired, but excited and sad because my husband is not here to share in the moment. I let the excitement of meeting my boy carry me, I promise myself to be strong and do what the nurses tell me. I start to push, i start and stop as instructed – I give it my best shot. One last push, make it a big one Sisi, someone instructs... I take the deepest breath yet and  i push. Someone else shouts – something is wrong, get the Dr. Within seconds the room was filled with so many people. .someone shouts, the baby is too big, his shoulders are stuck, we need to rotate blah blah... there's fingers or things shoved up my vagina, others hoist my legs up, there's a nurse on top of me pushing down on my stomach, while others hold my legs up... I lost my will – I just lay there, tossed, probed – I just go with it... I couldn't comprehend what was happening, and how fast it was happening. There's a lot of shouting, I feel a needle in my hand, another drip of some sort, someone said I was slipping... but I think to myself, 'I'm here', or was I, I don't know. They get him out eventually, at 12 midday. There was a  giant clock just in front of me that told me so. Its funny how I didn't notice it before. There was such a big relief when he was pushed or pulled out, I don't know. I just felt a big force and he was out - relief from amount of pressure i was feeling. He's not crying. Someone whisked him off to another table where he was surrounded by a group of people, all moving very fast... I just laid there, numb really. I thought about my husband, what will I say to my husband. I remember thinking, am I going to go home without a baby. I heard a very faint cry, very soft, very tired. That cry jolted me back to life. I was slipping away with my baby.  They placed him on my chest, momentarily, while the Dr was explaining what was going happen with him. They were taking him to the children's hospital, they will keep me updated and just like that he was gone. He was huge baby and his hands were white and a head full of hair – he looked like his father. I had 4th degree tearing, I had to go to surgery to get repaired. I only managed to speak to my husband almost 6 hours after I had given birth. I only saw my baby again the next day, early evening. We were in NICU for few days. His diagnosis overall was not severe, he had a mild shoulder dystocia, no brain damage but will have to be monitored for the next 6 years for any developmental/learning difficulties. By all accounts – he was expected to recover with mild physiotherapy for his shoulder. What followed was a tough journey to bond – to breastfeed – to heal. The overwhelm of early parenthood, the hormonal shifts, the trauma. He is three years old now. I was very stressed because i was going to be alone during the delivery. The lack of support from my husband made me very anxious. Physically, a 4th-degree tear came with complications. Weak pelvic floor, incontinence. Sex life – I was scared of physical penetration, in part because of the possible pain but also thinking if he will enjoy having sex with me again after so much tearing.  It caused tension in my marriage. Emotionally, it was very traumatic – and every year on his birthday, I got back there. I think about the trauma on my baby's big day. I feel sad that I will think about it every year. [During the first week] I was in so much pain. I couldn't sit properly because of the tearing. I was struggling with breastfeeding possibly from the trauma of birth, my milk was just not flowing right – which caused even more stress. We were discharged on a Friday and had a follow-up appointment the coming Monday. He was diagnosed with jaundice that Monday and we were readmitted on the spot. I cried, a lot. I had to endure another COVID test and another three nights in hospital, without my husband. I cried a lot during that time. I was interviewed by a psychologist during the first routine clinic visit, where I was very honest and open about my struggles but nothing came of it. I didn't pursue any further psychological support after that.  I read the 40 days postpartum newsletter religiously – it made me feel that I was not alone in the lot of the emotions I was feeling. My husband's job requires him to travel away from home quite a lot – so he was mostly away during my pregnancy and the baby was born. My mother came to stay and help for the first four weeks. I went back [to work] after 5 months. I am a Lecturer. My institution was supportive in allowing for a more flexible work schedule. The workload however was still unmanageable. Have I emerged even? Some parts are back, others are probably lost forever, and others are new, adaptive really. But I started to feel a little more capable when the baby was around 8-12 months old. I knew I was feeling more capable because I could go out with him to places without the overwhelming anxiety that used to accompany me. I was also doing my hair again and generally putting in some effort to regain some sense of my old self. ",

His diagnosis overall was not severe, he had a mild shoulder dystocia, no brain damage but will have to be monitored for the next 6 years for any developmental/learning difficulties. By all accounts – he was expected to recover with mild physiotherapy for his shoulder. 
    \n
    What followed was a tough journey to bond – to breastfeed – to heal. The overwhelm of early parenthood, the hormonal shifts, the trauma. He is three years old now.
    `,
    firstFortyDays: `Physically, a 4th-degree tear came with complications. Weak pelvic floor, incontinence. Sex life – I was scared of physical penetration, in part because of the possible pain but also thinking if he will enjoy having sex with me again after so much tearing. It caused tension in my marriage.
    \n
    Emotionally, it was very traumatic – and every year on his birthday, I got back there. I think about the trauma on my baby's big day. I feel sad that I will think about it every year. /n [During the first week] I was in so much pain. I couldn't sit properly because of the tearing. I was struggling with breastfeeding possibly from the trauma of birth, my milk was just not flowing right – which caused even more stress. We were discharged on a Friday and had a follow-up appointment the coming Monday. He was diagnosed with jaundice that Monday and we were readmitted on the spot. I cried, a lot. 
    \n
    I had to endure another COVID test and another three nights in hospital, without my husband. I cried a lot during that time. /n I was interviewed by a psychologist during the first routine clinic visit, where I was very honest and open about my struggles but nothing came of it. I didn't pursue any further psychological support after that.  I read the 40 days postpartum newsletter religiously – it made me feel that I was not alone in the lot of the emotions I was feeling. /n My husband's job requires him to travel away from home quite a lot – so he was mostly away during my pregnancy and the baby was born. My mother came to stay and help for the first four weeks. /n I went back [to work] after 5 months. I am a Lecturer. My institution was supportive in allowing for a more flexible work schedule. The workload however was still unmanageable. /n Have I emerged even? some parts are back, others are probably lost forever, and others are new, adaptive really. But I started to feel a little more capable when the baby was around 8-12 months old. I knew I was feeling more capable because I could go out with him to places without the overwhelming anxiety that used to accompany me. I was also doing my hair again and generally putting in some effort to regain some sense of my old self.`,

    birthStory:
      "After months of anticipation, the day finally arrived when we were set to welcome our second baby. Unlike with our first child, this time we knew what to expect in a planned C-section which brought a different kind of calm and excitement. A day before, we made sure everything was ready for the big day—bags packed, our older child staying with family, and the house prepped for bringing a newborn home. At the hospital, we were prepped for surgery, and everything seemed to move so quickly. The nurses were incredibly kind, walking us through each step. We had a private room where we relaxed until it was time to give both. Soon enough, I was in the operating room, the lights bright and everything feeling a bit surreal. My husband was right there by my side, holding my hand. Once the anesthetic kicked in, I couldn't feel anything from the waist down, but I was fully aware of the moment. I could feel pressure but no pain. Within 4 minutes, I heard the first cry of our baby boy. He was a beautiful, healthy boy! It was love all over again, just like the first time but different in its own way. After I held the baby for a few minutes, my husband left the room with our son while the doctors finished the surgery. Soon after, I was in recovery, and my baby was placed on my chest for skin-to-skin. I had a bad reaction to the anaesthetic and was fighting hard to stay awake while family gathered around the hospital bed to see baby. In retrospect, I would have preferred to not have had visitors immediately after giving birth. Recovery from the C-section was different than with my first birth, I experienced a lot of pain once I was released from hospital but in terms of taking care of baby, I was better prepared. [During the first week], baby was peaceful although physically I was in severe pain due to not having the correct meds. As a result I stopped breastfeeding very soon after birth. My husband was home and taking care of our older daughter for a week. Thereafter she returned to nursery school full time.  Our moms were also around to help bath baby and take care of him for short periods while I rested. We had domestic help for 3 days a week to keep our home neat and tidy. I was scheduled to return to work, but due to a compulsory mandate to return to office full time I resigned. Prior to giving birth, I had worked remotely for 4 years. [I felt myself reemerge] once I was physically healed and was able to be completely mobile again. Approximately 3 months after giving birth.",

    birthStory:
      "I have three children. In 2021 my family and I moved to the other side of the world, upon arrival I realised I was pregnant. I entered my new home through the maternity system. Pregnancy and birthing care in The Netherlands are midwife led. We planned a home birth. My previous births had been straightforward vaginal births so I was considered low risk and home births are encouraged in The Netherlands. In addition, I have little to no support here - there was no one to leave my other two children with when I went into labour (assuming my partner was present at the labour) so a home birth was the easiest option. My waters broke shortly after midnight on the 1st of January 2022, fireworks were still exploding all around us, the Dutch are obsessed with fireworks at New year. Our daughter was born approximately 3 hours later. I had rented an inflatable bath for a water birth. I enjoyed being in the water but found it slowed down my labour. I spent a fair amount of time climbing in and out of the water during the labour. My labours have all been straightforward and fairly quick but I enjoyed this home birth, I wouldn't say I enjoyed the other births. It was a very surreal experience, wondering around my living room in our tiny apartment in The Hague. Climbing in and out of the inflatable bath, slowly feeling the contractions speeding up. I sometimes sat on a birthing stool too that the midwife had brought along. She had arrived straight from her new years party. At first there was no assistant nurse because it was new year and it was hard to get hold of people. But the midwife found someone who arrived fairly quickly. The room wasn't even properly furnished, we took a long time to get things like furniture for various reasons. There was a Christmas tree still up in the corner. The midwife switched off all the lights and lit candles and put on the Christmas lights. Very atmospheric. I remember hearing music coming from outside, there were people partying in the street. At one point I could hear 'ice ice baby' by Vanilla Ice playing. Officially it was still strict lockdown because of Covid and no gatherings were allowed so people were in the street flaunting the rules. My husband was there most of the time, he was making tea for the midwife and nurse. At one point he had to check on the other kids, our older son woke up and he had to put him back to bed. The final delivery took place in the water with my husband right next to me and the midwife near by, I delivered my own baby with guidance from the midwife. The most astonishing thing was that the baby was a girl. We did not know what we were having and so far had boys. For some reason I thought I was having another boy. I loved her instantly. She was perfect. Did I feel safe, yes, was I afraid, no. I do not enjoy being pregnant so once I had given birth I was very relieved. It turned out my older two children did not go back to sleep and sat at the top of the stairs listening to everything. I think I liked that everyone was involved in the process, even if only in a distant way. Straight after the birth I was left wrapped up on the couch for at least an hour with my baby. It was an amazing experience. There was something comforting about being in my own home and then later being able to climb into my own bed. Compared to a hospital birth I found it much more relaxing, reassuring and empowering. My midwife was amazing. Labour is a weird process of completely letting go, I do not struggle with pain in labour, my pain tolerance is very high. I find myself trying to connect deeply with my body, listening to and feeling every sensation fully. I lose all sense of shame or even awareness of things like clothing. It is very basic in many ways, awareness of my breath is heightened. Yes, there is pain but for some reason it doesn't feel so important. The first 6 weeks were easy and difficult. My body slowly started adjusting. I was in a lot of pain, there was a problem with my pelvis which I eventually corrected with lots of exercise therapy. I developed shingles, which was not great. All my children got chickenpox shortly after this, not from me having shingles but from school. The baby had chickenpox too. It was easier because the baby was my third and I knew what to expect, I knew how to breastfeed etc. It was so hard because I was so far away from my support network. It was just me and my husband trying to hold it together with three children in a new country. We hadn't even been there a year. All my babies were wanted, nothing went as planned. The first week was easy. In The Netherlands they have Kraamzorg - maternity care. A dedicated nurse comes to your home for several hours everyday for the first 8 days. They will do whatever you ask them to do, clean, cook, play with your other children, bath the baby. They check on how breastfeeding is going, how you are sleeping, they give advice. It makes the first week easy. In addition, my partner took paternity leave. We rested, he spent time with the other children helping them to adjust, he cooked meals. I spent most of my time in bed feeding the baby or sleeping. It was very restful. It was just me and my husband, my husband works full time. I didn't have any family nearby, childcare is expensive here and there are long waiting list. It's hard to even find someone to help with cleaning. So my expectations to work were low, I had not been able to start working when we arrived. As a self employed person it has been hard to build new networks especially as I am the primary care giver. I progressed post partum at my own slow place. I found an exercise therapist to help with my pelvis. I went to pilates. Small things for me. My partner has been very supportive. He has done a huge amount while working full time and supporting us all. He cleans, he cooks, he takes the children to school, sometimes he fetches them. He has taken time off work if and when necessary. The Netherlands is supportive of partners being flexible and particpatory in childcare, which has also helped. He does not feel bad if he takes time off work to help with family stuff. He has worked a lot from home so that he can be more available to help. I want to [return to work] but I don't need to, I don't know what will happen in the future. I'm an artist and I feel very unsupported by the arts industry. We live in a very tiny apartment and currently can't afford to move. Sometimes we talk about me working because it might help with this but we can't figure out the childcare thing – it's expensive and waiting lists. It makes the most sense for me to wait until my youngest starts primary school when school becomes free.",

    birthStory:
      "Leaving the house was a very dramatic affair. I'd had two physical examinations - Karen checked once, after my water had broken in the passage - a big, gushing whoosh of release. I laughed, in my hot pink workout top and blue sarong around my hips. After my waters broke I abandoned the kikoy. I remember how in each pregnancy there's a moment that you forget your body for being a living thing that can be made pretty or fresher or lovelier or anything at all beyond a labouring body. My waters had never broken before - in the first labour, my midwife broke it and because I was already a few hours into labour (and laying down if I remember correctly), I didn't feel much. With the second one, she came with the waters! With this one, I wasn't expecting the waters at all... and then, the first indication that she would decide the pace and style of this labouring journey came this way... a big gush and release of water. There was some green in the waters and this led to my midwife wanting to check progress.Will and I drove to the birthing unit mostly in silence. Me on hands and feet on the back seat. Will in front, knuckles clenched and jaw tightening more than usual. It was impossible to even say a nice thing to each other although in that moment, I felt the silent affections between us... him wanting to say more, me still willing the baby to turn. I think back to the children at home - they looked so scared and confused. I remember thinking of novels I'd read before about mums being brave for their children; how being brave for the children required super human effort but was also, almost effortless, because immediately she knew it was required to protect them. They had been so excited before we left, singing and dancing 'The baby is coming today!' Yes, the baby is coming today, just not as planned.11am arrival - Karen walks down the short corridor of the birthing facility with determination.A little before 12 the baby is taken from my open body. She's shown to me. She moves across the room without me. Will, as many fathers in this situation feels torn. He goes with her, after I say not to worry about me. I lay there then, my body has expelled nothing, only dignity. Like in death, I imagine, one lay there, hoping for the best, aware that one exists now between a realm of here and there. With a vaginal delivery, I remember so distinctly the feeling of expelling the human. The separation of their body from the home that is (becomes 'was') my body is so distinct and real. The replacement of the person who was homed there for 9 months with a plethora or hormones is a vivid experience. It is alive and active. With the caesarian there was nothing like that. I remember thinking to myself how numb I felt, how absent, how desperate for the hormones - like I imagine one craves a drug. The irony was that I was on lots of drugs. In fact more than I'd ever been perhaps... but I hated every single clear liquid bag chugging into my veins. Into my veins, into the blood, into the milk, into her. I hated the drugs, I hated my body, I felt an indescribable sense of loss. Why!!? I'd seen and heard this many times before - the labour ended in an emergency caesar. Thankfully the baby and mum are safe. All that matters is that they are safe and here and alive. How much of this could I have changed, I still wonder now, to this very moment as I write these words.At home, we had left our forlorn children, our worried nanny and what looked like a crash scene...the people in the crash had been rushed to safety, to get help - physical help, nobody cared for the emotional or mental state of those people. Medicine - to keep you alive. Grateful you're alive, safe, here. I kept re-imagining it as I lay on that gurney after the surgery. The pool had been filled with water, the sun was out. The 3 towels filled with amniotic liquid tinged a little green lay on the wooden floors, some water dripping through onto my husband's makeshift desk downstairs... maybe onto the laptop. At least he has a nice memento - baby's poop in his everyday life. The shimmying of the hips and rolls and breathe... and... lower your shoulders... 'be with the surge', says my doula repeatedly. All these memories lay like carnage in our bedroom. In the aftermath of Zawe's labour I have a photograph of Tau looking at the miracle that was her presence - a 5 am slumber of awe and miracle embodied in her little body. In the aftermath of Sanaa's labour I only see flashes of this scene - abandoned and left behind. I tell her in the car that we are on our way to get her out... that we are coming. I believe she hears me but I don't know if she likes it. It takes us weeks - now day 21 - to start sniffing each other out.On that day - day 1 - on the gurney, nurses come in and out and ask why I'm not asleep.In the drugged slumber/ nightmare, I only think of how they operated AND I wasn't wearing panties. Why was there a need for such openness. I think of the noisy nurses chattering in the background. I see the surgeon's assistant calmly asking after my other two children...I think of Will's face looking at me, telling me it'll all be ok but seeing only terror in his eyes. I think of how I can't remember holding the baby. I remember how every time the nurses entered the room, how they seemed to be scolding that I wasn't asleep but that some part of me was trying to override the morphine to be present, to reach for my baby in that labour realm where her and I knew each other well. I felt drenched in sadness that I couldn't feel for the numbness that overwhelmed every part of me... and her. I stared at her limp little body against my unfeeling one. Nobody told me I'd have to lay here for hours until the anaesthetic wore off. Minutes before being cut open the anaesthetist casually asks about our music choice. I wanted to scream that we had not planned music, that we had not planned THIS! Instead - Kyle Shepherd, Dream state, comes to mind, as I lay there - Jesus on the cross style with my vag and breakfast on display - I hear the sounds of the trio - piano, bass, trumpet... I focus on the instruments. She arrives to the sound of this music and the syncopation that is Jazz... a dream state way of arriving earth side.",

    birthStory:
      "My labour was planned as baby was breech, so it had to be a C-section (I come from a long line of breech babies including me, my brother, and my mom who was delivered by C-section in the 1950s, so it was not a massive surprise). Before it was confirmed that baby was not going to turn, my gynae said it was up to me how I wanted to deliver (I believe this is common in South African private hospitals) and that there were pros and cons to both caesar and vaginal.'They're both shit', I remember her concluding. I was kind of relieved I wasn't given a choice. I was terrified, labelled as a 'mature' mother in my late 30s after having gone through IVF after not falling pregnant naturally for around six years (possibly due to endometriosis), I was made fully aware of all the possible complications and risks at my age. I was aware that I was lucky to have fallen pregnant, for the first time in my life, with only one viable embryo, and after only one cycle of IVF. The whole process felt like a strange and unbelievable lottery of life. I always describe it as both a horror show and a miracle.Going through the c-section, was admittedly horrible in its own way even though it went relatively well and there were no complications. I could see my husband, who is an anaesthetist, was shaking with nerves. My own anaesthetist was lovely and gentle, as was my gynae who had somehow chosen the most incredible playlist, I loved every song, which calmed me (the only one I can remember is Teenage Dirtbag, which although possibly not pertinent theme wise made me incredibly happy). What was perhaps disturbing about the op was that in the light above I could see a reflection of everything happening below. All I saw was blood and organs, literally coming out of me. Once baby was out, I could hear and see a sense of urgency and rush to reassemble my insides, which is probably not exactly what was happening medically but that is how I perceived it. Everyone sang happy birthday and baby was good, and me and husband cried, and I utilised the morphine pump to address the crazy levels of pain and or discomfort I was feeling. This perhaps made thing a bit fuzzy, although I feel I remember that moment pretty well. Because it was deep COVID lockdown, my husband couldn't stay, and I could have no visitors and I was alone with my baby in our own hospital room, which at the time actually did feel like privilege and a blessing. Apart from those first few hours of just taking each other in, things started to go a bit downhill. From the op you can barely move, can't walk, are reliant on sisters for everything. My biggest issue was feeding. I read various books convincing me that I was going to breast feed no matter what. It was definitely the best way, I had decided. I didn't even research bottle feeding, I had no intention of doing it. It was, to this day, the hardest thing I ever tried to do. Compounded with the pain of the op, the pain of breastfeeding was indescribable, literally blood and pus and bruising.This was with the acknowledgement that I would need help and guidance, employing a lactation consultant who came to see me in the hospital room. After leaving the hospital, being at home for two days and going to my first paed visit, I was readmitted to hospital with a baby whose weight had dropped dangerously low and whose bilirubin scores were alarmingly high, due to feeding issues. I could only feed from one breast, the other was too bruised and bleeding. I've never felt like such a failure, I was struggling to keep my first and only child alive, after all my struggling to even fall pregnant. My heart broke as I looked at him lying under the blue phototherapy light. The sisters in the paed ward were also far less compassionate than those in labour ward. Through the night I had to wake up every 1.5 hours to use the hospital pump, and when I didn't pump enough they scolded me for messing up my schedule. I had the worst never-ending headache, was the most sleep-deprived I had ever been in my life, was swollen, bleeding and in pain from the op, and it sounds dramatic, but at points I wasn't sure I was able to survive the physical and emotional pain. After he was a fed a combination of whatever I could pump and formula to supplement it when we were readmitted to hospital, the bili levels dropped and and we went home the next day. He was around 5 days old at that point. I'm happy to admit it – formula saved his life. The first week was basically a battle to get my supply up, and just remembered being attached to pump day and night (recommended by the lactation consultant as well as skin on skin) almost the entire time. I only recently deleted all my alarm clocks set to every two hours, and remembered that madness.  ",

    birthOnly: `My labour was planned as baby was breech, so it had to be a C-section (I come from a long line of breech babies including me, my brother, and my mom who was delivered by C-section in the 1950s, so it was not a massive surprise). Before it was confirmed that baby was not going to turn, my gynae said it was up to me how I wanted to deliver (I believe this is common in South African private hospitals) and that there were pros and cons to both caesar and vaginal.'They're both shit', I remember her concluding. I was kind of relieved I wasn't given a choice. \n I was terrified, labelled as a 'mature' mother in my late 30s after having gone through IVF after not falling pregnant naturally for around six years (possibly due to endometriosis), I was made fully aware of all the possible complications and risks at my age. I was aware that I was lucky to have fallen pregnant, for the first time in my life, with only one viable embryo, and after only one cycle of IVF. The whole process felt like a strange and unbelievable lottery of life. I always describe it as both a horror show and a miracle. \n Going through the C-section, was admittedly horrible in its own way even though it went relatively well and there were no complications. I could see my husband, who is an anaesthetist, was shaking with nerves. My own anaesthetist was lovely and gentle, as was my gynae who had somehow chosen the most incredible playlist, I loved every song, which calmed me (the only one I can remember is Teenage Dirtbag, which although possibly not pertinent theme wise made me incredibly happy). What was perhaps disturbing about the op was that in the light above I could see a reflection of everything happening below. All I saw was blood and organs, literally coming out of me. Once baby was out, I could hear and see a sense of urgency and rush to reassemble my insides, which is probably not exactly what was happening medically but that is how I perceived it. Everyone sang happy birthday and baby was good, and me and husband cried, and I utilised the morphine pump to address the crazy levels of pain and or discomfort I was feeling. This perhaps made thing a bit fuzzy, although I feel I remember that moment pretty well. \n Because it was deep COVID lockdown, my husband couldn't stay, and I could have no visitors and I was alone with my baby in our own hospital room, which at the time actually did feel like privilege and a blessing. Apart from those first few hours of just taking each other in, things started to go a bit downhill. From the op you can barely move, can't walk, are reliant on sisters for everything. My biggest issue was feeding. I read various books convincing me that I was going to breast feed no matter what. It was definitely the best way, I had decided. I didn't even research bottle feeding, I had no intention of doing it. It was, to this day, the hardest thing I ever tried to do. Compounded with the pain of the op, the pain of breastfeeding was indescribable, literally blood and pus and bruising.This was with the acknowledgement that I would need help and guidance, employing a lactation consultant who came to see me in the hospital room.  `,

He was around 5 days old at that point. I'm happy to admit it – formula saved his life. The first week was basically a battle to get my supply up, and just remembered being attached to pump day and night (recommended by the lactation consultant as well as skin on skin) almost the entire time. I only recently deleted all my alarm clocks set to every two hours, and remembered that madness.
