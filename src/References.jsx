            , will emphasise the process of recalling birth or coming home
            stories, exploring the way in which data and narrative can express
            the nuances of this unique period in a mother or parent’s life,
            which is often difficult to express. It is a collaborative project,
            primarily inspired by the work of Dee Marco around motherhood and
            community. After Dee worked with Independent Network for
            Contemporary Culture & Art (INCCA) on their Art After Baby project,
            her and INCCA founder Lara Koseff found common ground in their
            interest in trying to find new ways to tell the many little stories
            of motherhood that often go unrecorded or unsaid. Below are a series
            of references that influenced this collaboration.

                The core inspiration for this project is Dee Marco’s Tiny
                Letters: 40+ days post-partum – a series of diary-like entries
                about her life as a mother of three small children. It started
                in February 2023 after the traumatic labour and birth of her
                third child and the slew of feelings that accompanied her
                arrival. Dee’s Tiny Letters is ongoing and you can read more and

                Dear Data is a year-long, analog data drawing project by Giorgia
                Lupi and Stefanie Posavec, two award-winning information
                designers living on different sides of the Atlantic. By
                collecting and hand drawing their personal data and sending it
                to each other in the form of postcards, they became friends.
                “Each week, and for a year, we collected and measured a
                particular type of data about our lives, used this data to make
                a drawing on a postcard-sized sheet of paper, and then dropped
                the postcard in an English ‘postbox’ (Stefanie) or an American
                ‘mailbox’ (Giorgia)… Eventually, the postcard arrived at the
                other person’s address with all the scuff marks of its journey
                over the ocean: a type of ‘slow data’ transmission.” While not
                related to motherhood specifically, this project motivated Dee
                and Lara to consider a form of collaboration through data
                storytelling, one in which the minutiae of everyday life is
                visualised. They decided to specifically focus on the first 40
                days postpartum, to create a resource so that mothers can
                potentially feel less alone and isolated during one of the most
                tumultuous periods in a care-givers life. Read more{" "}

                Mary Kelly’s Post-Partum Document is a six-year exploration of
                the mother-child relationship. When it was first shown at the
                ICA in London in 1976, the work provoked tabloid outrage because
                Documentation I incorporated stained nappy liners. Each of the
                six-part series concentrates on a formative moment in her son’s
                mastery of language and her own sense of loss, moving between
                the voices of the mother, child and analytic observer. Informed
                by feminism and psychoanalysis, the work has had a profound
                influence on the development and critique of conceptual art.
                Both Dee and Lara always followed the work of Mary Kelly, but
                both revisited it in a new light as mothers, noting that now, in
                many societies, almost half a century since it was first
                exhibited, there subsists a sense of shame about the daily
                realities of motherhood.
